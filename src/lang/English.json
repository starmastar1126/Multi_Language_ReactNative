        "body1": "<h2>Testimony of Faith: Meaning and Requirements||<p>Ash hadu an laa ilaaha illallaah, wa ash hadu anna Muhammadan rasool-ullaah (I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah)||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 190px; height: 285px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/mosque.jpg\" />||<h3>Why the Statement “Laa ilaaha illallaah”?||<ul>||<li>Because it is the first duty of a Muslim. Therefore, whoever intends to accept Islam must make such a declaration of faith and believe in it.||<li>Because whoever says it, sincerely believing in it and seeking thereby Allah’s pleasure, will be saved from Hellfire, as the prophet ﷺ said, “Allah has forbidden for the Hellfire anyone who says, ‘There is no one worthy of worship except Allah,’ seeking thereby Allah’s pleasure.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 415)||<li>Because whoever dies while believing in it will be admitted into Paradise, as the prophet ﷺ said, “Whoever dies knowing full well that there is no god but Allah will enter Paradise.” (Musnad Ahmad:464)||<li>Because knowledge of its meaning and dictates, is unquestionably the greatest and most important duty of a Muslim.||<h3>The Meaning of Laa ilaaha illallaah||<p>This means no one is worthy of worship except Allah. In fact, this statement negates the existence of any other deity besides Allah ﷻ and confirms that Allah is the only True God worthy of being worshipped.||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 190px; height: 285px;\">||<caption>Peace and tranquillity can only be attained by worshipping Allah alone without associating any partners with Him in worship. .||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/mosque2.jpg\" />||<p>The Arabic word ilaah (god) refers to any being that is worshipped. Thus, whoever worships something has in fact taken it as a god besides or instead of Allah. All such deities are indeed false except for one God—Allah, the true Lord and Creator.||<p>Therefore, Allah ﷻ alone deserves to be worshipped. It is He alone whom human hearts must worship with utmost love, glorification, humility and fear, and He alone should be relied upon and invoked. No one should be called upon, sought for help or relied upon except Allah. Prayers and sacrifices must be offered to Him alone, and He ought to be worshipped in all sincerity, as the Qur’an states, “They were only ordered to worship Allah, keeping religion pure for Him.” (Soorat Al-Bayyinah, 98:5)||<p>Those who sincerely worship Allah, following the dictates of the testimony of faith, will certainly lead a happy life, for it is only by worshipping Allah alone that hearts find peace and real satisfaction, as the Qur’an states, “Whoever does good, whether male or female, and he is a believer., We will most certainly make him live a happy life.” (Soorat An-Nahl, 16:97)||<h3>The Two main Parts of Laa ilaaha illallaah||<p>This great statement comprises two parts which must be known in order to understand its meaning and requirements:||<div id=\"div-box\">||<div id=\"section-dotted\">||<div id=\"left-dotted-box\">||<p>The First Part: Laa ilaaha (There is no god), negates the existence of any other deity besides Allah I, rejects association of partners with Allah in worship (shirk), and requires disbelief in any being or thing that is worshipped besides Allah, be it a human being, an animal, an idol, a star or anything else.||<div id=\"right-dotted-box\">||<p>The Second Part: illallaah (except Allah), confirms that Allah is the only True God worthy of being worshipped and thus all acts of worship, such as the prayer, invocation and reliance, must be directed to Him alone.||<p>||<p>All acts of worship must be directed to Allah alone; whoever directs any act of worship to other than Allah is, strictly speaking, an unbeliever.||<p>The Qur’an states, “Whoever calls on another god together with Allah has no proof for doing so at all, and his reckoning is with his Lord. Truly the unbelievers have no success.” (Soorat Al-Mu’minoon, 23:117)||<p>The significance of Laa ilaaha illallaah along with its two main parts are mentioned in the following verse: “Whoever rejects false gods and believes in Allah has grasped the Firmest Handhold, which will never give way.” (Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2:256)||<p>The words “whoever rejects false gods” provides the meaning of the first part of the testimony of faith, namely, Laa ilaaha; while the words “and believes in Allah” provides the meaning of its second part, namely, illallaah.",
        "title2": "The Testimony that Muhammad is Allah’s Messenger",
        "body2": "<h2>The Testimony that Muhammad is Allah’s Messenger||<p>Who is Allah’s Messenger?||<h3>His Birth||<p>Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was born in Makkah in 570 CE. His father died before his birth, and his mother also died when he was very young. Thus, he was placed under the care of his paternal grandfather, ‛Abdul-Muttalib, and, after his grandfather’s death, he was placed under the care of Abu Taalib, one of his paternal uncles.||<h3>His Life and Upbringing||<p>Muhammad ﷺ spent forty years before he received revelation in the Makkan tribe of Quraysh into which he was born, and during this period (570-610 CE) he came to be known amongst his people as assaadiq al-ameen (the truthful and trustworthy) because of his uprightness and excellent manners. He worked as a shepherd and later as a merchant. Before the advent of Islam, he maintained the pure monotheistic beliefs of Prophet Abraham ﷺ, a haneef , worshipping Allah alone without ascribing any partners to Him and rejecting idol worship and pagan practices..||<h3>His Mission||<p>When Allah’s Messenger ﷺ turned forty, he would regularly retreat to the Cave of Hiraa’, on the peak of Mount Noor on the outskirts of Makkah, in present-day Saudi Arabia, meditating and worshiping Allah. It was then that he started receiving revelation from Allah. The first verses he received there were: “Read in the name of your Lord who created. He created man from a clot of blood. Read, and your Lord is the Most Generous; He who taught by the pen; taught man that which he knew not.” (Soorat Al-‛Alaq, 96:1-5) These verses ushered in a new era of knowledge, reading, light and guidance. The Qur’anic revelations continued until his death twentythree years later.||<h3>The Beginning of His Mission||<p>After three years of preaching secretly, Allah’s Messenger ﷺ spent another ten years preaching Islam openly. During this period, he and his Companions were subjected to all forms of injustice and persecution at the hands of the Quraysh pagans. Not losing heart, he began presenting himself during the pilgrimage season to the pilgrims who came from various tribes, calling them to the new faith. Pilgrims from Madeenah accepted Islam and, soon afterwards, Muslims started migrating to their city in successive groups.||<h3>His Migration||<p>At the age of fifty-three, Allah’s Messenger ﷺ migrated to Madeenah, which was then called Yathrib, in 622 CE, after the Quraysh notables who had opposed his mission plotted to kill him. He spent ten years there, inviting people to Islam, and enjoined the prayer, zakaat and the other Islamic rituals on the Muslims.||<h3>His Efforts to Spread Islam||<p>Following his migration to Madeenah (622-623 CE), Allah’s Messenger ﷺ laid the foundation for Islamic civilisation and determined the aspects of the Muslim society. He eradicated tribal fanaticism, spread knowledge, established the principles of justice, righteousness, fraternity, cooperation and organisation. Some tribes attempted to put an end to Islam once and for all, leading to a number of skirmishes and wars, but Allah ﷻ supported His Messenger and made Islam reign supreme. Then, people in Makkah and in most cities and tribes in the Arabian Peninsula willingly began entering this great religion in crowds, fully convinced that it is the true religion..||<h3>His Death||<p>In the lunar month of Safar , 11 AH (June 632 CE), after Allah’s Messenger ﷺ disseminated the message of Islam and Allah had completed His favour upon the Muslims by perfecting His religion for them, the Messenger ﷺ had a sudden onset of fever which led to his death on Monday Rabee‛ Al-Awwal 11 AH (8 June 632 CE) at the age of 63. He was buried where he died, in the apartment of his wife ‛Aa’ishah ~, which is now housed within the Prophet’s Mosque in Madeenah.||<table style=\"width: 100%;\">||<tbody>||<tr>||<td>Our Prophet’s Name</td>||</tr>||<tr>||<td>Muhammad ﷺ was the son of ‛Abdullaah, son of ‛Abd Al-Muttalib of the Banu Haashim clan of the Quraysh.

        "body1": "<h2> The Six Pillars of Faith (Eemaan)||<h3>The Meaning of Belief in Allah I||<p>This means firm belief that Allah ﷻ exists, resolutely affirming His Lordship, Godship and Names and Attributes.||<p>We will now discuss these four issues at length as follows:||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"1\">Belief in the Existence of Allah||<h4>The Innate Disposition to Believe in Allah (Fitrah)||<p>Affirming the existence of Allah is something that is innate in human beings and does not require anything to prove it. Indeed, it is for this reason that most people acknowledge God’s existence despite their different religious beliefs We know in our heart of hearts that Allah exists because we always seek His assistance and support in times of hardship or when a calamity strikes because of the innate inclination to believe in Him and worship Him (fitrah) which He has instilled into us even though some people attempt to obliterate it or ignore it. The numerous incidents we have heard or seen about people having their prayers answered, their wishes granted and their distress relieved proves beyond any shadow of doubt that Allah ﷻ does exist.||<p> ||<h4>Proofs for Allah’s Existence are Clear and Countless||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 280px; height: 260px;\">||<caption>Man himself is one of the major signs which testify to Allah’s existence. We only need to reflect on the blessings of reason, the senses and the well-proportioned and perfectly designed bodies with which Allah ﷻ has endowed us, as the Qur’an states, “There are certainly signs [of Allah’s existence] in yourselves as well. Do you not then see?” (Soorat Add-Dhaariyaat, 51:21)||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/human_body.jpg\" />||<ul>||<li> Everybody inherently acknowledges the laws of causality, that is, everything has a determinate cause. The numerous creatures we see around us must have a causative agent, that is undoubtedly Allah, for it is impossible for anything to be created without a creator, just as it is impossible for it to create itself, as the verse states, “Or were they created out of nothing, or are they the creators?”(Soorat At-Toor, 52:35) This verse simply means that people were not created without a Creator, nor could they have created themselves, which obviously means that it was Allah ﷻ who created them.||<li>The superbly flawless plan in the universe, including its most subtle elements, its heaven, earth, constellations and trees, among numerous other great marvels and impressive wonders, prove without a doubt that it has one Creator who is Allah, as the verse states, “This is the handiwork of Allah who has perfected all things.” (Soorat An-Naml, 27:88) All the stars and planets, for instance, consistently orbit around their respective common centre of mass.||",
        "title2": "Belief in Allah’s Lordship",
        "body2": "<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"2\">Belief in Allah’s Lordship||<h4>The Meaning of Belief in Allah’s Lordship||<p>This means to firmly believe that Allah ﷻ is the Lord, the Creator, the Sustainer and the provider of everything; that He is the one who gives life and causes death; that He is the only one who can do harm and good; that all power of decision rests with Him; that in His hand is all good; that He has power over everything; and that He has no partner whatsoever in doing all this.||<p>Belief in Allah’s Lordship therefore requires a Muslim to believe that:||<p class=\"dashed-box1\">Allah is the only creator of everything in the universe, as the Qur’an states, “Allah is the Creator of everything.” (Soorat Az-Zumar, 39:62) Man’s creativity merely involves such processes as transforming something from one state into another, assembling and building; it does not involve originating creation, creating something out of nothing or bringing it to life after death||<p class=\"dashed-box2\">He is the only One who provides sustenance to His creation and no one else can do so, as the Qur’an states, “There is no creature on the earth which is not dependent upon Allah for its provision.” (Soorat Hood, 11:6)||<p class=\"dashed-box3\">He is the master and owner of everything “The kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything in them belongs to Allah.” (Soorat Al-Maa’idah, 5:120)||<p class=\"dashed-box4\">He is the sole ruler who regulates all affairs of the universe: “He directs the whole affair from heaven to earth.” (Soorat As-Sajdah, 32:5) Man’s management of his worldly affairs is rather limited and depends on whatever material is at his disposal. Besides, in so doing, he can either meet with success or experience failure. However, Allah’s regulation of the affairs of the universe is comprehensive and is bound to be effectual, for there is nothing that would otherwise thwart it in any way, as the Qur’an states, “Both creation and command belong to Him. Blessed be Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.” (Soorat Al-A‛raaf, 7:54||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 190px; height: 180px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/horizon.jpg\" />||<h4>The Arab Polytheists at the Time of the prophet ﷺ Believed in Allah’s Lordship||<p>The Arab polytheists at the time of the prophet ﷺ affirmed Allah’s Lordship; they believed that He is the creator, the master and disposer of all affairs, but such affirmation alone was not sufficient for them to be admitted into the fold of Islam. As the Qur’an states, “If you asked them, ‘Who created the heavens and the earth?’ they would say, ‘Allah!’ Say: ‘Praise be to Allah!’ But most of them do not know.” (Soorat Luqmaan, 31:25)||<p>Indeed, affirmation that Allah is the Lord of all the worlds, that He is the master and sustainer entails that all acts of worship must be directed to Him alone, without taking any partners whatsoever with Him in worship.||<p>It would be ludicrous to affirm that Allah is the creator of everything, the disposal of all affairs and the one who gives life and causes death and then we direct an act of worship to other than Him. Indeed, doing so is a tremendous wrong and the worst of all sins, as the Qur’an states, “When Luqmaan said to his son, counselling him, ‘My son, do not associate anything with Allah. Associating others with Him is a terrible wrong.’” (Soorat Luqmaan, 31:13)||<p>When the prophet ﷺ was asked about the greatest sin in the sight of Allah, he replied, “To set up a rival to Allah in worship though He alone created you.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 4207; Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 86)||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 190px; height: 285px;\">||<caption> Belief in Allah’s Lordship sets the heart at rest .||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/duaa.jpg\" />||<h4>Belief in Allah’s Lordship Sets the Heart at Rest||<p>When one firmly acknowledges that none of Allah’s creation can challenge His decree, being the creator and king of all mankind who decrees whatever He deems wise for them, who is their only creator, sustainer and disposer of all affairs, whom nothing as small as an atom moves or settles except with His decree, one’s heart becomes attached to Almighty Allah, asking none but Him, relying on Him in all worldly matters and dealing with all the ups and downs of life calmly and confidently, with determination and perseverance. For once we have done what we can possibly do to achieve a worldly goal and have prayed to Allah for assistance, we have actually done our duty. In this way, we become contented, as we do not covet what others may have, fully aware that all power of decision rests with Allah who creates whatever He wills and chooses for mankind whatever is best for them.",

This entails that all the apparent and hidden acts of worship, such as invocation, fear, reliance, the prayer, the obligatory charity (zakaat), fasting and seeking assistance, must be directed to Him alone, as the Qur’an states, “Your God is One God. There is no god but Him, the Most Beneficent the Most Merciful.” (Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2:163) This verse makes it abundantly clear that Allah is only one God, which means that He alone deserves to be worshipped and that no one else must be worshipped besides or instead of Him.||<h4>Importance of the Belief that Allah is the Only God Worthy of Worship||<p>The importance of the belief that Allah is the only God who deserves to be worshipped is apparent in a number of aspects:||<ol>||<li>Worshipping Allah is the ultimate purpose of human and jinn existence, as the Qur’an states, “I have only created the jinn and man to worship Me.” (Soorat Adh-Dhaariyaat, 51:56)||<li>Worshipping Allah is also the reason behind Allah’s sending messengers and revealing divine books to affirm that Allah is the only God worthy of worship and to reject false deities worshipped besides or along with Him, as the Qur’an states, “We sent a messenger among every people saying: ‘Worship Allah and keep clear of all false gods.’” (Soorat An-Nahl, 16:36)||<li>Worshipping Allah is the first duty of man towards his creator. Giving instructions and orders to Mu‛aadh ibn Jabal t upon sending him to Yemen, the prophet ﷺ said to him, “You are going to a people from among the People of the Book. Let the first thing you call them to be to testify that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 1389; Saheeh Muslim: 19) That is, let them direct all acts of worship to Him alone.||<li>The belief that Allah is the only God worthy of worship is the actual realisation of the meaning of the statement Laa ilaaha illallaah. The Arabic word ilaah (generally translated ‘God’) refers to any being that is worshipped. Therefore, there is no God who truly deserves to be worshipped except Allah, and thus no act of worship must be dedicated except to Him alone.||<li>The belief that Allah is the only God worthy of worship is the logical outcome of the belief that He is the creator, the master and the disposer of all affairs.||",
        "title4": "The Meaning of Worship (‛Ibaadah)",
        "body4": "<h2> The Meaning of Worship (‛Ibaadah)||<p>The Arabic term ‛ibaadah comprises all the words and deeds which Allah ﷻ loves and approves of and which He has commanded or recommended, whether such words and deeds are apparent, such as the prayer, zakaat or pilgrimage; or hidden, such as love for Allah and His Messenger ﷺ, fear of Allah, reliance upon Him and seeking His assistance.||<p> ||<h3>Worship Encompasses all Aspects of Life||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block-white bar\" style=\"width: 270px; height: 200px;\">||<caption>All the good acts that are done with good intentions are considered acts of worship for which man will be rewarded.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/doctor_quran.jpg\" />||<p>Worship (‛ibaadah) embraces all the believer’s acts if he intends to do them with the intention of getting closer to Allah ﷻ. Therefore, the concept of worship in Islam is not confined to the common rituals, such as the prayer and fasting; rather, it includes all beneficial acts that are done with good intentions. In this way, all the good acts a Muslim does are considered acts of worship for which he will be rewarded in the hereafter. If he eats, drinks or sleeps, for instance, with the intention of getting strength to be able to obey Allah, he will be rewarded for this intention. A Muslim, therefore, lives all his life for Allah. His eating to get strength to obey Allah, his marriage to keep away from unlawful sexual acts, seeking knowledge, getting a university degree, making discoveries, and a woman’s care for her husband, children and home are all acts of worship as long as they are coupled with a good intention.||<h3>The Reason behind the Creation of the Jinn and Mankind||<p>Allah says, “I have only created the jinn and man to worship Me. I do not require any provision from them and I do not require them to nourish Me. Truly, Allah is the Provider, the Lord of Power, the Ever Mighty.” (Soorat Adh-Dhaariyaat, 51:56-8)||<p>Allah ﷻ informs us in this verse that the reason behind creating the jinn and mankind is to worship Him. In fact, He is not in need of their worship; rather, it is they who need to worship Him because of their total dependence upon Him.||<p>Allah ﷻ informs us in this verse that the reason behind creating the jinn and mankind is to worship Him. In fact, He is not in need of their worship; rather, it is they who need to worship Him because of their total dependence upon Him. If man neglects a duty towards his creator and gives free rein to the worldly pleasures without contemplating the divine reason behind his existence, he becomes just like any other creature without any privileges whatsoever over other creatures. Animals, too, eat and enjoy themselves but they will not be brought into account on the Day of Judgement, as man will be: “Those who reject Allah will enjoy this world and eat as cattle eat; and the Fire will be their abode.” (Soorat Muhammad, 47:12) By neglecting their duty towards their Lord, they are just like animals, but contrary to animals, they will be punished for their disobedience because, unlike animals, they have been endowed with the faculty of reason.||<h3>Pillars of Worship||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 190px; height: 285px;\">||<caption>For worship, or ‛ibaadah, to be valid and accepted, it has to be directed sincerely to Allah alone and done in conformity with His Messenger’s Sunnah.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/prayer.jpg\" />||<p>The kind of worship Allah has legislated is based on two important pillars: The First Pillar: Total humility and fear The Second Pillar: Complete love for Allah ﷻ Therefore, worship (‛ibaadah), which Allah has commanded His slaves to observe must be accompanied with (1) total submission to, and humility before Allah while fearing Him, and (2) complete love for Him, asking, invoking and imploring none but Him. Love that is not accompanied with fear and humility, such as love for food and wealth, cannot be considered worship. By the same token, fear that is not accompanied with love, such as fear of a ferocious beast or a tyrant ruler, cannot be considered worship. For worship to be realised when doing an act, both love and fear must be realised, and this can only be directed to Allah alone. .||<h3>Conditions of Worship||<p class=\"style3\">For worship, or ‛ibaadah, to be valid and accepted, two conditions must be met:||<div id=\"div-box\">||<div id=\"section-dotted\">||<div id=\"left-dotted-box\" style=\"width: 46%;\">||<p style=\"width: 247px;\">Following the guidance of Allah’s Messenger <span style=\"color: #666666; font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">ﷺ</span>.||<div id=\"right-dotted-box\" style=\"width: 37%;\">||<p>Sincerity: It has to be directed sincerely to Allah alone.||<p>Highlighting this point, the Qur’an states, “Indeed, those who submit themselves to Allah and act righteously will be rewarded by their Lord: They will have no fear, nor will they grieve.” (Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2:112)||<p>The clause ‘those who submit themselves to Allah’ means that they realise the essence of monotheism by sincerely worshipping Allah alone.||<p>The words ‘act righteously’ means that they follow Allah’s law and the guidance (Sunnah) of Allah’s Messenger <span style=\"color: #666666; font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">ﷺ</span>.||<p id=\"note\">It is worth noting here, however, that following the Prophet’s guidance relates only to pure acts of worship, such as the prayer, fasting and remembrance of Allah; it does not relate to those acts which fall under the general meaning of worship (‛ibaadah ), that is, those acts and practices which one does with a good intention in order to receive reward from Allah, such as exercising with the intention of getting strength to worship Allah better and engaging in trade to support one’s family. Engaging in such activities only requires avoidance of acting against the Prophet’s teachings or committing a forbidden act.",
        "title5": "Shirk is of two Types: Major Shirk and Minor Shirk",
        "body5": "<h2> Associating Partners with Allah in Worship (Shirk)||<ul>||<li>Shirk contradicts the belief that Allah alone is worthy of worship. While the belief that Allah alone deserves to be worshipped and that all acts of worship must be directed to Him constitutes the greatest and most important duty of a Muslim towards his Lord, shirk is considered to be the greatest sin in the sight of Allah and is the only sin which He never forgives without sincere repentance. The Qur’an says, “Allah does not forgive anything being associated with Him in worship, but He forgives whoever He wills for anything other than that.” (Soorat An-Nisaa’, 4:48) When the prophet ﷺ was asked about the greatest sin in the sight of Allah, he replied, “To set up a rival to Allah in worship though He alone created you.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 4207; Saheeh Muslim: 86)||<li>Indeed, shirk renders acts of worship invalid and worthless, as the Qur’an states, “If they had associated others with Him, nothing they did would have been of any use.” (Soorat Al-An‛aam, 6:88) Those who commit the unpardonable sin of shirk will be doomed to Hellfire for all eternity, as the Qur’an states, “Those who associate anything with Allah in worship, for them Allah has forbidden Paradise and their abode will be the Fire.’” (Soorat Al-Maa’idah, 5:72)||<h3>Shirk is of two Types: Major Shirk and Minor Shirk||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"1\">Major Shirk: This involves directing any act of worship to other than Allah. Therefore, directing words or deeds that Allah loves to Him alone testifies to monotheism and true faith, while directing them to other than Allah constitutes an act of unbelief and shirk.||<p>Examples of this type of shirk include asking someone other than Allah to cure one of an illness or to increase one’s wealth, relying on other than Allah and prostrating to other than Him. Allah says, “Your Lord says, ‘Call on Me and I will answer you.” (Soorat Ghaafir, 40:60)||<p>“Put your trust in Allah if you are indeed believers.” (Soorat Al-Maa’idah, 5:23)||<p>“Prostrate before Allah and worship Him.” (Soorat An-Najm, 53:62)||<p>Therefore, whoever directs any act of worship to other than Allah is, strictly speaking, an unbeliever.||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"2\">Minor Shirk: This involves those words or deeds which serve as a vehicle to commit the major shirk. Examples of this type of shirk include making one’s prayer sometimes a little longer or reciting the Qur’an a little louder for the sake of showing off. The prophet ﷺ once observed, “The thing that I fear most for you is the minor shirk.” His Companions asked, “What is the minor shirk, Messenger of Allah?” He replied, “Showing off.” (Musnad Ahmad: 23630) However, if a person performs acts of worship entirely for showing off, and were it not for the sake of people he would never offer the prayer or observe a fast, then he is definitely a hypocrite. Doing so is undoubtedly a major shirk which takes one out of the fold of Islam altogether.||<p> ||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block-white bar\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 230px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/help_hands.jpg\" />||<h3>Does Asking People Amount to Committing Shirk?||<p>Islam aims to free the human mind from the shackles of superstitions and from submitting to none other than the One True God-Allah ﷻ||<p>Therefore, it is not permissible to ask the dead or inanimate beings for anything or humbly submit to them; doing so constitutes sheer superstition and is a blatant act of shirk.||<p>It is permissible, however, to ask the living for whatever they can possibly do, such as saving us from drowning or asking them to pray to Allah for us.||",

All His names and attributes are unique, as the Qur’an states, “Nothing is like Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.” (Soorat Ash-Shooraa, 42:11) Therefore, none of whatever He has created has similar names or attributes in any way.||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block-white bar\" style=\"width: 280px; height: 222px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/ayat.jpg\" />||<h3>Some of Allah’s Most Beautiful Names||<p>“The Beneficent, the Merciful.” (Soorat Al-Faatihah, 1:3)||<p>“He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.” (Soorat Ash-Shooraa, 42:11)||<p>“He is the Mighty, the Wise.” (Soorat Luqmaan, 31:9)||<p>“Allah, there is no god but Him, the Living, the Self-Sustaining.” (Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2:255)||<p>“All praise is due to Allah, Lord of all the worlds.” (Soorat Al-Faatihah , 1:2)||<div id=\"fruits\">||<h4>Benefits of Belief in Allah’s Names and Attributes||<ol>||<li>||<p>Getting to know Allah ﷻ better, for belief in Allah’s names and attributes increases one’s knowledge of Allah, which in turn increases one’s faith in Him.

The more a Muslim neglects his duty towards Allah and disobeys Him, the more his faith decreases. Conversely, the more he obeys Allah, worships Him and fears Him, the more his faith increases.||<p>The highest level of faith is what Islam terms ihsaan (literally perfection, charity, performance of good deeds, etc.), which the prophet ﷺ defined as follows: “It is to worship Allah as though you are seeing Him and while you see Him not, yet truly He sees you.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 50; Saheeh Muslim: 8)||<p>Therefore, you must remember that Allah is watching you all the time, whether you are standing or sitting, being serious or joking, and thus you must not disobey Him while you know that He is always watching you. Do not let fear and despair get the better of you while you know that Allah is with you. You will by no means experience loneliness when you privately pray to Allah and invoke Him. How can you commit a sin while you firmly believe that Allah is fully aware of what you do secretly and publicly? If, however, you commit a sin, repent to Allah and seek His forgiveness, He will certainly forgive you and accept your repentance.||<div id=\"fruits\">||<h4>Some Benefits of Belief in Allah I||<ol>||<li>||<p>Allah safeguards the believers against harm and adversity and protects them against their enemies’ plots, as the Qur’an states, “Surely Allah defends those who are true believers.” (Soorat Al-Hajj, 22:38)||<li>||<p>Belief in Allah brings happiness and is the source of a good life, as the Qur’an states, “To whoever does good deeds, man or woman, and is a believer, We will surely give a good life.” (Soorat An-Nahl, 16:97)||<li>||<p>Belief in Allah frees the human mind from superstitions. Those who believe in Allah ﷻ completely rely on Him and are wholly devoted to Him, being the Lord of all the worlds and the only true God without any partners. As a result, they do not fear anyone and show their devotion to none but Allah. This frees them from all superstitions and misconceptions.||<li>||<p>The best benefit of belief in Allah is attainment of Allah’s good pleasure, admission into Paradise and enjoyment of everlasting bliss and Allah’s boundless mercy.||<div style=\"margin: 0 auto; padding-bottom: 20px;\">||<div><img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/kids_read_quran.jpg\" style=\"border: 1px solid #fff;\" />||",

Indeed, a divine message is the spirit, light and the very life of the world, without which the world would certainly be lifeless and man would be plunged into the darkness of ignorance and misguidance?||<p>It is for this reason that Almighty Allah calls His message a spirit, for there is no life without a spirit, as the Qur’an says, “We have thus revealed a Spirit to you by Our command. You knew neither the Scripture nor the faith, but We made it a light, guiding with it whomever We will of Our servants. You are indeed guiding to the straight path.” (Soorat Ash-Shooraa, 42:52)||<p>Even though the intellect can generally distinguish between right and wrong, it cannot possibly comprehend the details of such a distinction, nor carry out acts of worship in the right manner without the dictates of revelation and the divine message.||<p>Therefore, success and happiness can only be attained by following the guidance of Allah’s messengers. Similarly, no accurate line of demarcation can be drawn between right and wrong without following in their footsteps. Thus, whoever rejects the divine message will definitely lead a miserable and wretched life depending on the extent of their rejection of it.||<h3>It Is One of the Pillars of Faith||<p>Belief in Allah’s messengers is one of the six pillars of eemaan (faith), as the Qur’an states, “The Messenger believes in that which has been revealed to him from his Lord and so do the believers. Each one believes in Allah and His angels and His books and His messengers.” (Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2:285)||<p>This verse makes it abundantly clear that we must believe in all of Allah’s messengers without making a distinction between any of them. We must not, therefore, believe in some of them and reject some others, as did the Jews and the Christians.||<p>Defining eemaan (faith), the Prophet ﷺ also said in this connection, “It is to believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers and the Last Day, and to believe in the divine decree, both good and bad.” (Saheeh Muslim: 8)||<h3>The Meaning of Belief in the Messengers||<p>This means firm belief that Allah ﷻ sent a messenger to every nation and community, calling its members to worship Allah alone without any partners, that all Allah’s messengers were truthful, virtuous, trustworthy and rightly-guided servants who strove hard to guide their people to the right path and conveyed Allah’s message to them in full, without concealing, omitting or adding anything to it. The Qur’an says, “Therefore, the messengers’ obligation is no more than to convey the message clearly.” (Soorat An-Nahl, 16:35)||<div>||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 550px; height: 219px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/land.jpg\" />||",
        "title2": "What Does Belief in the Messengers Include?",
        "body2": "<h3>What Does Belief in the Messengers Include?||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"1\">To believe that their message was truly from Allah ﷻ and that Allah had sent them with the same message, namely, to worship Allah alone and to avoid false gods, as the Qur’an states, “We sent a messenger among every people saying: ‘Worship Allah and keep clear of all false gods.’” (Soorat An-Nahl, 16:36)||<p>Laws may vary as to the do’s and don’ts of the message with which prophets were sent to their people, depending on what laws suited their people best, as the Qur’an states, “For each [community to which a Messenger was sent with a Book] have We appointed a law and a practice.” (Soorat Al-Maa’idah, 5:48)||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"2\">To believe in all the prophets and messengers. We believe in those prophets whom Allah has named, such as Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad, may Alloh’s peace and blessings be upon all of them. As for those whom He has not named, we believe in all of them in general. Those who disbelieve the message of one single prophet is considered to have disbelieved in all of them.||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"3\">To believe the authentic reports and accounts of the prophets and their miracles mentioned in the Qur’an and in the Prophet’s traditions, such as the story of Allah’s parting the Red Sea for Moses u.||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"4\">To act according to the dictates of the law revealed to our Prophet Muhammad r, who was the seal of the prophets and the best of all of them.||<p>Some Characteristics of the Messengers||<ol>||<li>They are human, and the only difference between us and them is that Allah had chosen them to receive His revelation and convey His divine message, as the Qur’an says, “We have only ever sent before you men to whom We revealed the message.” (Soorat Al-Anbiyyaa’, 21:7) Therefore, they have no divine attributes whatsoever. They are mere human beings who attained perfect physical appearance and enjoyed impeccable moral traits. They are also the most honourable of people in lineage and enjoyed sound judgement and clear, persuasive speech, which entitled them to assume the responsibility of conveying the divine message and bear the burden of prophethood. Almighty Allah ﷻ has only chosen messengers from among people so that they can set a good example for them, and so that people can follow in their footsteps, which they can possibly do.||<ol start=\"2\">||<li>Allah ﷻ has chosen them from among people so they can convey the divine message to people, as the Qur’an states, “Say: ‘I am only a human being like you who has received revelation. Your god is One God. So let him who hopes to meet his Lord act rightly and not associate anyone in the worship of his Lord.’” (Soorat Al-Kahf, 18:110) It is clear, therefore, that prophethood cannot be attained as a result of spiritual purity, intelligence or mental logic, for the task of prophethood can only be determined by divine will, and Allah ﷻ knows best whom to appoint as His messengers, as the Qur’an states, “Allah knows best upon whom to bestow His message.” (Soorat Al-An‛aam, 6:124)||<ol start=\"3\">||<li>They are infallible in the sense that they do not make mistakes when conveying Allah’s message to the people and executing what Allah has revealed to them.||<li>Truthfulness: They are truthful in their words and deeds, as the Qur’an states, “This is what the Most promised, and the messengers told the truth.” (Soorat Yaa Seen, 36:52)||<li>Patience and Perseverance: They called to Allah’s religion, bringing good news and giving warning, and were subjected to various forms of harm and hardships, but they patiently bore all that for the sake of making the word of Allah reign supreme, as the Qur’an states, “So be steadfast as the Messengers with firm resolve were also steadfast.” (Soorat Al-Ahqaaf, 46:35)||<h3>The Messengers’ Signs and Miracles||<p>Allah ﷻ supported His messengers with a number of signs and miracles to prove their truthfulness and prophethood. A miracle, or mu‛jizah, is an extraordinary event in the physical world that surpasses all known human or natural powers. It is performed by prophets, by Allah’s command, for its credential value, to accredit them as Allah’s true messengers||<p class=\"style1\">Examples of miracles include:||<ul>||<li> Moses’s rod turning into a snake||<li> Jesus’s informing his people of what they ate and stored in their houses||<li>The splitting of the moon for Prophet Muhammad r||",
        "title3": "A Muslim’s Beliefs regarding Jesus u",
        "body3": "<h3>A Muslim’s Beliefs regarding Jesus u||<ol>||<li>He was one of the greatest of Allah’s messengers and one of those held in high esteem. Indeed, he is one of the messengers Allah describes in the Qur’an as having ‘firm resolve’, namely, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon all of them. About these prophets, the Qur’an states, “We made a covenant with all the Prophets – with you and with Noah and Abraham and Moses and Jesus son of Mary – We made a binding covenant with them.” (Soorat Al-Ahzaab, 33:7)||<li>He was a mere human being with no divine attributes whatsoever, whom Almighty Allah sent to guide the Children of Israel and supported with a number of miracles, as the Qur’an states, “He is only a slave on whom We bestowed Our blessing and whom We made an example for the tribe of Israel.” (Soorat Az-Zukhruf, 43:59) He never ordered his people to take him and his mother, Mary, as gods besides Allah; he only told them to do as Allah commanded him to tell them: “Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.” (Soorat Al-Maa’idah, 5:117)||<li>||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 260px; height: 350px;\">||<caption> Muslims believe that Jesus ﷺ was one of the greatest of Allah’s messengers, that he had no divine attributes whatsoever and that he was neither killed, nor crucified.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/aqsa.jpg\" />||<li>He was the son of Mary, a chaste, pious and truthful virgin who entirely devoted herself to the worship of Allah. She gave birth to Jesus after miraculously conceiving him without a human father, his likeness in this being as that of Adam, as the Qur’an states, “The likeness of Jesus in Allah’s sight is the same as Adam. He created him from earth and then He said to him, ‘Be!’ and he was.” (Soorat Aal-‛Imraan, 3:59)||<li>There was no prophet between him and Muhammad r. In fact, Jesus u gave the good news of the advent of Prophet Muhammad r, as the Qur’an states, “And when Jesus son of Mary said, ‘O Children of Israel, I am the Messenger of Allah to you, confirming the Torah which came before me and giving you the good news of a Messenger to come after me whose name is Ahmad.’ When he brought them the Clear Signs, they said, ‘This is downright magic.’” (Soorat As-Saff, 61:6)||<li>We believe in the miracles he performed by Allah’s permission, such as his ability to heal the lepers, bringing dead people back to life and informing his people of what they ate and stored in their houses, all by Allah’s permission. Allah gave him the ability to perform such miracles to prove he was a true prophet who came with a divine message from his Lord.||<li>A person will not be considered a true believer unless he believes that Jesus u was Allah’s servant and messenger and strongly rejects the false statements Jews make about him and which Allah dismiss as untrue. He must al strongly reject the Christian beliefs about Jesus, who have gone far astray for taking him and his mother as gods besides Allah, claiming that he was the son of God or adopting the doctrine of the Trinity, referring to Allah as “the third of three”. Glorified is He and High Exalted above what they say!||<li>He was neither killed, nor crucified; instead, he was raised up by Allah to heaven. In fact, Allah gave someone else Jesus’ appearance, causing everyone to believe that Jesus was crucified. The Qur’an says about this, “And their saying, ‘We killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah.’ They did not kill him and they did not crucify him but it was made to seem so to them. Those who argue about him are in doubt about it. They have no real knowledge of it, just conjecture. They did not really kill him. Allah raised him up to Himself. Allah is Almighty, All-Wise. There is not one of the People of the Book who will not believe in him before he dies; and on the Day of Rising he will be a witness against them.” (Soorat An-Nisaa’, 4:157-59) In this way, Allah ﷻ protected him and raised Him to heaven. He will eventually return to earth towards the end of the world, rule by Muhammad’s law; then he will die and be buried, and will eventually be resurrected, like all human beings, as the Qur’an states, “From it We created you, to it We will return you, and from it We will bring you forth a second time.” (Soorat Taa Haa, 2o:55)||",
        "title4": "Belief in Muhammad  as a Prophet and Messenger",
        "body4": "<h4>Belief in Muhammad r as a Prophet and Messenger||<ul>||<li> We believe that Muhammad ﷺ was Allah’s servant and messenger, that he is the best of all mankind without exception, the seal of the prophets and so there will be no prophet after him. He Fully delivered the divine message assigned to him, discharged his prophetic duties, sincerely counselled the Muslim community, and strove hard for the cause of Allah to the best of his ability.||<li> We believe what he said, obey his commands and avoid the acts he prohibited and warned us against. We must worship Allah according to his guidance (Sunnah) and take none but him as our example. The Qur’an says, “You have an excellent model in the Messenger of Allah, for all who hope for Allah and the Last Day and remember Allah much.” (Soorat Al-Ahzaab, 33:21)||<li> We must show more love for the prophet ﷺ than for our own parents, children and indeed all humankind. “None of you will be a true believer,” the prophet ﷺ once observed, “until he loves me more than his parents, his children and all mankind.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 15 and Saheeh Muslim: 44). However, true love for the prophet ﷺ can only be realised by following his Sunnah. Indeed, true happiness and complete guidance cannot be attained without obeying him, as the Qur’an states, “If you obey him, you will be guided.’ The Messenger is only responsible for delivering the message clearly.” (Soorat An-Noor, 24:54)||<li>We must accept everything he has brought to us from Almighty Allah, adhere to his Sunnah, holding his guidance in high esteem, as the Qur’an states, “By your Lord, they will not be true believers until they seek your arbitration in their disputes and find within themselves no doubt about what you decide and accept it wholeheartedly.” (Soorat An-Nisaa’, 4:65)||<li> We must avoid disobeying his orders, for doing so is bound to lead to trials, misguidance and a severe punishment in the hereafter, as the Qur’an states, “Those who oppose his command should beware of a testing trial coming to them or a painful punishment striking them.” (Soorat An-Noor, 24:63)||<h3>Characteristics of Prophet Muhammad’s Message||<p class=\"style1\">Prophet Muhammad’s message has a number of characteristics which distinguish it from the previous divine messages. These include:||<ul>||<li> It was the final divine message, as the Qur’an states, “Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but the Messenger of Allah and the Final Seal of the Prophets.” (Soorat Al-Ahzaab, 33:40)||<li>It abrogated all previous messages and laws, and thus no religion will be acceptable to Allah after Muhammad’s mission except Islam. This can only be done by following Prophet Muhammad’s guidance. Similarly, no one will be admitted into Paradise without following in his footsteps, for he is the most honourable of all Allah’s messengers, his community (ummah) is the best community that has ever been brought forth for the good of mankind and his law is the most comprehensive of all divine laws. The Qur’an says, “If anyone desires anything other than Islam as a religion, it will not be accepted from him, and in the next world he will be among the losers.” (Soorat Aal-‛Imraan, 3:85) The prophet ﷺ also said, «By Him in whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, any person of this Community, Jew or Christian, who hears of me and dies without believing in what I have been sent with will be among the inhabitants of Hell.” (Saheeh Muslim: 153; Musnad Ahmad: 8609)||<li>It is addressed to both the jinn and mankind. Recounting the statements of some of the jinn who embraced Islam, the Qur’an states, “Our people, respond to Allah’s caller and believe in Him.” (Soorat Al-Ahqaaf, 46:31) Addressing Muhammad r, the Qur’an also says, “We only sent you for the whole of mankind, bringing good news and giving warning.” (Soorat Saba’, 34:28) In this connection, the prophet ﷺ said, “I have been favoured over the other prophets in six ways: I have been given the gift of concise yet comprehensive speech; I have been supported with fear [which Allah cats into my enemies’ hearts]; war booty has been made permissible for me; the entire earth has been made a means of purification and a place of worship for me; I have been sent to all of mankind; and the line of Prophets ends with me.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 2815; Saheeh Muslim: 523)||<div id=\"fruits\">||<h4>Benefits of Belief in Allah’s Messengers||<p>Belief in Allah’s messengers has a number of benefits, including the following:||<ol>||<li>||<p>Awareness of Allah’s care for His slaves for sending messengers to them to guide them to the right path and show them how to worship Allah. Indeed, the human mind cannot possibly do this. Addressing Prophet Muhammad r, Allah ﷻ says, “We have only sent you as a mercy to all the worlds.” (Soorat Al-Anbiyaa’, 21:107)||<li>||<p>Showing gratefulness to Allah for this great blessing.||<li>||<p>Showing love for Allah’s messengers, holding them in high esteem and adequately praising them for delivering Allah’s message to their people and giving them good counsel.||<li>||<p>Following the guidance contained in the message which the messengers have brought from Allah, namely, to worship Allah alone without associating any partners with Him in worship and adhering to the dictates of this message. This will bring about happiness for the believers in both this life and in the life to come. The Qur’an says, “Those who follow My guidance will not go astray and will not be wretched. But whoever turns away from My reminder, he will lead a miserable life.” (Soorat Taa Haa, 20:123-24)||<div>||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 550px; height: 210px;\">||<caption> Al-Aqsa Mosque, located in the old city of Jerusalem, is regarded by Muslims with great respect.

        "body1": "<h2> Belief in the Last Day||<h3>Meaning of Belief in the Last Day||<p>Firm belief that Almighty Allah will raise people to life from their graves; He will then judge them according to their deeds. Those who deserve to go to Paradise will be sent to it, while those who deserve to go to Hellfire will be sent to it.||<p>Belief in the last Day is one of the articles of faith, and faith will not be valid unless one believes in the Last Day, as the Qur’an states, “Truly pious are those who believe in Allah and the Last Day.” (Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2:177)||<h3>Why Does the Qur’an Emphasise Belief in the Last Day?||<p>The Qur’an emphasises belief in the last Day and draws attention to it on numerous occasions, employing different modes of expression in Arabic and linking belief in the Last Day with belief in Allah.||<p>The reason for this is that belief in the Last Day is a necessary outcome of belief in Almighty Allah and His absolute justice. To illustrate:||<p>Allah does not approve of injustice; He will not let the wrongdoers go unpunished, nor will He let the wronged down by not obtaining redress for the wrong done to them, nor will He disappoint the virtuous by not rewarding them for their righteousness. Many are those who spent all their lives oppressing others with impunity until they died; many are those who suffered a great deal of injustice and died without ever obtaining redress for the wrong done to them. This means there has to be another life, other than the present life, where the righteous will be rewarded and the evildoers will be punished, everyone getting the reward or punishment they deserve.||<div>||<div class=\"mosaic-block-white bar\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 280px;\">||<caption> Islam teaches us to save ourselves from Hellfire by showing kindness to others even by giving half of a date-fruit in charity.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/date.jpg\" />||",
        "title2": "What Does Belief in the Last Day Include?",
        "body2": "<h3>What Does Belief in the Last Day Include?||<p>Belief in the Last Day includes a number of things, some of which are as follow:||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"1\">Belief in the Ultimate Resurrection and Gathering: This means that Almighty Allah will raise people to life from their graves, and each soul will return to its respective body. People will then stand before the Lord of all the worlds for judgement. They will be gathered on a huge level plain, naked and barefoot just as Allah ﷻ first created them.||<p>Indeed, belief in the resurrection of the dead is confirmed by textual evidence from the Qur’an and the Sunnah and has been proven rationally as well as through the inner nature (fitrah). We therefore firmly believe that Allah will raise the dead from their graves, their souls will return to their respective bodies and all people will stand before the Lord of the worlds for judgement.||<p>The Qur’an says, “Then subsequently you will certainly die. Then on the Day of Rising you will be raised again.” (Soorat Al-Mu’minoon, 23:15-16)||<p>All divine books have confirmed this fact, stating that part of Allah’s wisdom behind creating people is to set an ultimate day on which He will judge them for obeying or rejecting His commands which he sent down to them through His messengers, as the Qur’an states, “Did you suppose that We created you for amusement and that you would not return to Us?’” (Soorat Al-Mu’minoon, 23:115)||<h4>Some Textual Evidence from the Qur’an Regarding Resurrection||<ul>||<li>It was Allah ﷻ who created mankind the first time, and He is able to bring them back to life, as the Qur’an states, “And it is He who originates creation, then brings it back again, and it is easier for Him.” (Soorat Ar-Room, 30:27) Refuting the false claim that it is impossible for bones to be restored to life when they are decayed, Almighty Allah says, “Say, ‘He who made them in the first place will bring them back to life.’” (Soorat Yaa Seen, 36:79)||<p> ||<ul>||<li>When the earth is barren and lifeless, Allah pours rain down upon it, and it stirs and swells and brings forth every kind of lovely plant. The One who can bring it to life is certainly able to bring the dead back to life, as the Qur’an states, “And We sent down blessed water from the sky and made gardens grow by it and grain for harvesting, and tall palm-trees with their thickly-clustered dates, as provision for Our slaves; by it We brought a dead land to life. Thus will be the resurrection.” (Soorat Qaaf, 50:9-11)||<li>Every sensible person admits that if someone can do something hard, then he can, with all the more reason, do something easier than that. Therefore, if Almighty Allah was able to create the wonderful heavens, the vast earth and all the mighty stars, then He can, with all the more reason, easily bring bones that have decayed, back to life, as the Qur’an states, “Does He who created the heavens and earth not have the power to create [from rotten bones] the like of them again? Yes indeed! He is the Creator, the All-Knowing. (Soorat Yaa Seen, 36:81)||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"2\">Belief in the Judgement and the Balance of Deeds: Almighty Allah will judge people according to their deeds which they did in the life of the world. Those who worshipped Allah alone and obeyed Him and His Messenger Muhammad r will receive an easy reckoning. As for those who committed the unforgivable sin of shirk and disobeyed Him, they will receive a severe reckoning.||<p>People’s deeds will be weighed in a huge balance. The good deeds will be placed on one weighing pan, while the bad deeds will be placed on the pan at the other end of the Balance. Those whose good deeds outweigh their bad deeds will be admitted into Paradise, while those whose bad deeds outweigh their good deeds will be sent to Hellfire, and Allah does not wrong anyone.||<p>Allah ﷻ say, “We will set up the Just Balance on the Day of Rising and no one will be wronged in any way. Even if it is no more than the weight of a grain of mustard-seed, We will produce it. We are sufficient as a Reckoner.” (Soorat Al-Anbiyyaa’, 21:47)||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"3\">Paradise and Hellfire: Paradise is the abode of eternal bliss which Allah r has prepared for the pious people who have obeyed Allah and His Messenger r. In it they will find all that their hearts desire and their eyes find delight in.||<p>Awakening His servants’ desire to vie with one another in obeying Him so that they will be admitted into Paradise, Almighty Allah says, “Race each other to forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden as wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared for the righteous.” (Soorat Aal- ‛Imraan, 3:133)||<p>As for Hellfire, it is the abode of eternal punishment which Allah has prepared for the unbelievers who have rejected Allah and disobeyed His messengers. In it they will find all kinds of unimaginable terrifying punishments and suffering.||<p>Warning His servants against the Hellfire, Almighty Allah says, “Fear the Fire whose fuel is people and stones, made ready for the unbelievers.” (Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2:24)||<p>We ask You, O Allah, to admit us into Paradise and to assist us in saying words and doing deeds that are bound to bring us closer to it, and we seek refuge with You from the Hellfire and from words and deeds that are bound to bring us closer to it.||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"4\">Punishment and Bliss in the Grave: We believe that death is a fact, as the Qur’an states, “Say: ‘The Angel of Death, who has been given charge of you, will take you back and then you will be sent back to your Lord.’” (Soorat As-Sajdah, 32:11)||<p>In fact, no one can deny death; we believe that when someone dies or is killed by any means whatsoever, it is because his appointed time has come, which he can neither delay nor bring forward, as the Qur’an states, “When the end of the term falls, they can neither delay it by a single moment, nor can they hasten it.” (Soorat Al-A‛raaf, 7:34)||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 220px; height: 310px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/cemetery.jpg\" />||<ul>||<li>We also believe that whoever dies has actually moved to life hereafter.||<li>There are numerous authentic traditions attributed to Prophet Muhammad r in which he mentions punishment in the grave for the unbelievers and the wicked people and bliss for the believers and upright people. We believe in all this, but we abstain from trying to find out how this may happen, for the human mind cannot possibly comprehend its manner or reality, being part of the unseen world, such as Hellfire and Paradise, and not part of the material, visible world. The human mind can only carry out analogical reasoning and deductive arguments and reach judgements in matters which have the same relationship and whose laws are known in the visible world.||<li>Life in the grave is part of the unseen world which cannot be perceived by the senses. Were this possible, belief in the unseen would be of no benefit whatsoever, there would be no wisdom behind observance of religious duties and people would not find it necessary to bury the dead. As the prophet ﷺ once observed, “Were it not that you would not bury one another, I would pray to Allah to make you hear the punishment in the grave which I can hear.” (Saheeh Muslim: 2868; Sunan An-Nasaa’ee: 2058). It is because animals are exempt from religious duties that they can hear the voices of those punished in their graves.||",
        "title3": "Benefits of Belief in the Last Day",
        "body3": "<div id=\"fruits\">||<h4>Benefits of Belief in the Last Day||<ol>||<li>||<p>Belief in the Last Day prompts people to lead a pious life, do righteous deeds, fear Allah ﷻ and stay away from selfishness and arrogance. It is for this reason that the Qur’an frequently links belief in the Last Day with righteous deeds. The following verses are examples showing this: “The mosques of Allah should only be frequented by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day.” (Soorat At-Tawbah, 9:18) “Those who believe in the hereafter do believe in it, and they are ever-mindful of their prayers.” (Soorat Al-An’aam, 6:92)||<li>||<p>It reminds those who are totally absorbed in the life of the world and its transitory pleasures of the importance of vying with one another to obey Allah, urging them to do as many good deeds as they are alive and showing them that the worldly life is fleeting and that the hereafter is the everlasting abode. After praising His messengers in the Qur’an and mentioning their righteous deeds, Allah ﷻ mentions the reason that prompted them to do such virtuous acts: “We purified their sincerity through sincere remembrance of the Abode.” (Soorat Saad, 38:46) This means that their constant remembrance of the hereafter was the reason behind their performance of such acts. When some of the Muslims became too sluggish to obey Allah and His Messenger r on one occasion, Allah ﷻ revealed the following verse, “Do you prefer the life of this world to the hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, compared to that of the hereafter.” (Soorat At-Tawbah, 9:38) Belief in the hereafter makes a person realise that all worldly comforts cannot be possibly compared to the eternal bliss in Paradise, nor is it worth one single dip in Hellfire; conversely, it makes one realise that all worldly discomforts and hardships for the sake of Allah cannot be possibly compared to punishment, in Hellfire, nor will it be compared to even one dip in Paradise.||<li>||<p>It makes a person satisfied with his lot in life. He does not feel sad or lose heart if he misses a worldly opportunity. Rather, he does what he can possibly do, knowing for certain that Allah will not let the reward of anyone who does a good deed go to waste. If anything has been unjustly or deceitfully taken away from him, even if it is smaller than an atom, he will certainly get it back on the Day of Judgement when he will be in dire need of it. How then can someone feel sad when he knows for sure that he will get his rightful dues at a very critical moment on the Day of Judgement? How can he possibly grieve or be worried when he knows that it is the Best of Judges who will judge between him and his adversaries?||",

Nothing can happen without His will, and not even the like of a weight of an atom in the heavens or the earth escapes His knowledge. However, He commands His servants to do certain acts and forbids them to do certain others, giving them free will to do whatever they please without being forced to do anything against their will. He created them as well as their ability to do things. He guides whomever He wills in His mercy and misguides whomever He wills in His absolute wisdom. He will not be questioned about what He does, but people will be questioned for what they do.||<div id=\"note\">Belief in the divine decree is one of the pillars of faith. When the prophet ﷺ was once asked about faith, he said, “It is to believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day and to believe in the divine decree, the good and the bad of it.” (Saheeh Muslim: 8)",

It remains to be said that man’s will and ability can only take place following those of Almighty Allah, as the Qur’an states, “It is nothing but a Reminder to all the worlds to whoever among you wishes to go straight.

        "title5": "Benefits of Belief in the Divine Decree",
        "body5": "<div id=\"fruits\">||<h4>Benefits of Belief in the Divine Decree||<p>Belief in the divine decree has numerous benefits in people’s lives, including the following:||<ol>||<li>||<p>It is one of the best incentives to act in a manner that is pleasing to Almighty Allah in this life. The believers are commanded to do what they can possibly do, to the best of their ability, relying upon Allah I. They believe that whatever they do cannot possibly yield any results without Allah’s will, because Allah is the Creator of the causes and effects. The prophet ﷺ once said, “Cherish that which gives you benefit [in the Hereafter], seek help from Allah and do not lose heart. If anything unpleasant happens to you, do not say, ‘If I had done such-and-such, such-and-such would have happened instead.’ Rather say, ‘Qaddarallaahu wa maa shaa’a fa‛ala (This is Allah’s decree, and He does whatever He wills)’, for the words ‘if only’ begin the work of Satan.” (Saheeh Muslim: 2664)||<li>||<p>Belief in divine decree prompts man to realise his own self worth, and so he tries to avoid self-conceit and arrogance, for he knows that he does not know what has been decreed for him. This makes him admit his weakness and need for Allah ﷻ and thus urges him to turn to Him constantly. Generally, man becomes conceited when something good happens to him and becomes rather sad and dejected when something bad befalls him. Only belief in the divine decree will protect man from such arrogance in times of ease and dejection in times of hardship, for he knows that things happen according to Allah’s decree and His foreknowledge.||<li>||<p>Belief in divine decree helps overcome the vice of envy. A true believer does not envy people for the bounties Allah has bestowed upon them, for He knows that it is Allah ﷻ who has granted them such bounties in the first place and that envying others is tantamount to objecting to Allah’s decree.||<li>||<p>It fills the believer’s heart with courage and strengthens his determination in the face of hardships, for he knows that his worldly provision and appointed time to depart the world has already been decreed by Allah ﷻ and that nothing will happen to him except what Allah has decreed for him.||<li>||<p>It instils in him the numerous realities of faith. Consequently, he constantly seeks Allah’s assistance, places his trust in Allah after doing what is required of him and always shows his need for Allah from whom he derives support to stay on the straight path.||<li>||<p>It provides him with reassurance and fills his heart with peace and contentment, for he knows that what has passed him by was not going to befall him and that what has befallen him was not going to pass him by.||",

Before he performs such ablution, he is said to be in a state of a major ritual impurity.\\r These things are as follows:||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 190px; height: 285px;\">||<caption>To perform the full ablution, the entire body must be washed with water.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/shower.jpg\" />||<ol>||<li>Ejaculation with pleasure and by any means, while asleep or awake.\\r Ejaculation involves the expulsion of seminal fluid, a thick whitish fluid, from the urethra of the penis during orgasm, which is generally followed by a feeling of lethargy and inertia||<li>Sexual intercourse: This involves penetration even if it does not lead to ejaculation. In fact, mere penetration of the glans into the vagina provides sufficient grounds for performing ghusl, i.e.taking a ritual bath. The Qur’an says, “If you are in a state of major impurity, then purify yourselves.”(Soorat Al-Maa’idah, 5:6)||<li><span class=\"style1\">Menstrual blood and post-natal bleeding\\r </span>•Menstrual blood is a natural type of blood, which flows from the uterus of women and occurs at roughly monthly intervals during a woman’s reproductive years. It usually lasts more or less seven days with some variation from one woman to another.\\r •Post-natal bleeding: This bleeding takes place following a delivery in the post-natal period and lasts for a number of days.||<p>Menstruating women and women experiencing their post-natal bleeding are exempt from fasting as well as from performing the prayers. They must, however, make up for their missed fasts but not for the missed prayers. During this period, a husband and wife can satisfy their sexual desire but without having an intercourse. At the end of menstruation and post-natal bleeding, women must take a ritual bath (ghusl).||<p>As the Qur’an states, “They will ask you about menstruation. Say, ‘It is an impurity, so keep apart from women during menstruation and do not approach them until they have purified themselves. But once they have purified themselves, then go to them in the way that Allah has enjoined on you.’” (Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2:222)",

He can continue doing so for a period not exceeding 24 hours for a resident and 72 hours for a traveller.||<p>The feet must, however, be washed when performing a ritual bath to remove janaabah.||<p>||<div id=\"photo-text-box\"><img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/tap.jpg\" height=\"289\" width=\"172\" style=\"float: right;\" />||<div class=\"content\">||<h4>What to Do in Case One Is Unable to Use Water||<p>If a Muslim is unable to use water to perform wudoo’ or take a ritual bath (ghusl) due to illness, when water is not readily available or when using the available water for wudoo’ or ghusl would leave insufficient water for drinking, he can resort to pure earth as a substitute for ablution. This is called tayammum, and he can continue to do so until he finds sufficient water or becomes able to use it.\\r Manner of Performing Tayammum: (1) Strike both hands slightly on pure earth once, (2) wipe the face with them, (3) wipe the back of the right hand with the palm of the left, and then the back of the left hand with the palm of the right hand.||",

The intention is the object for which the prayer is offered. Before offering the prayer, one must have in mind the intention to offer the specified prayer, as being the sunset prayer or the late evening prayer, for instance, for the purpose of worshipping Allah I. A Muslim must not announce the intention, and doing so is a mistake, for neither the prophet ﷺ, nor his noble companions ever declared it.||<li>He then stands in reverence and humility, raising his hands up to the level of the shoulders or a little above them, with the palms of his hands facing the qiblah, and says, as he does so, Allaahu akbar (Allah is Most Great). The takbeer (that is, the Arabic phrase Allaahu akbar) is a way of extolling and glorifying Allah I. Indeed, Allah is greater than everyone and everything else. He is greater than the life of this world and all its transitory desires. When we declare the takbeer, we leave the worldly concerns and earthly desires behind us and turn towards Allah, Most High, the All-Exalted, in great reverence and utmost humility.||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block-white bar\" style=\"width: 230px; height: 253px;\">||<div><img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/p2.jpg\" />||<ol>||<li value=\"3\">Then he places his right hand on the left hand, having both of them on his chest. He maintains this whenever he is in a standing position.||<li>Then He recites the opening supplication: Subhaanak-Allaahumma wa bi hamdika, wa tabaarak-asmuka, wa ta‛aalaa jadduka, wa laa ilaaha ghayruka (Glory be to You, Allah; Yours is the praise, blessed is Your name, exalted is Your majesty, and there is no god besides You). This supplication is recommended but not obligatory.||<li>Then he says: A‛oodhu billaahi min-ash-shaytaan-ir-rajeem (I seek Allah’s protection from Satan, who has been expelled from His mercy).||<li>Then he says: Bismillaah-ir-rahmaan-ir-raheem (In the name of Allah, Most Beneficent, Most Merciful).||<li>Then he recites Soorat Al-Faatihah, the greatest soorah in the Qur’an.||<ul>||<li>Allah ﷻ reminds the prophet ﷺ of His favour upon him by revealing it to him: “We have given you the seven oft-repeated verses and the Magnificent Qur’an.” (Soorat Al-Hijr,15:87)||<li>A Muslim must learn it by heart, for reciting it in prayer constitutes one of the pillars of the prayer for those who pray alone or behind the imaam in prayers during which Qur’anic verses are recited in a low voice, such as the afternoon and late afternoon prayers.||<ol>||<li value=\"8\">He says after reciting Soorat Al-Faatihah or listening to it behind the imaam: Aameen, which means “O Allah, answer my prayers.”||<li>After reciting Soorat Al-Faatihah,he recites another soorah or some other Qur’anic verses. In the third and fourth units of the prayer he recites only Soorat Al-Faatihah.||<ul>||<li>Soorat Al-Faatihah and whatever Qur’anic verses are recited after it are normally recited aloud in the dawn (Fajr), sunset (Maghrib)and late evening prayers (‛Ishaa’). As for the afternoon (Dhuhr)and late afternoon prayers (‛Asr ), they are recited in a low voice.||<li> All the supplications are normally recited in a low voice.||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block-white bar\" style=\"width: 182px; height: 250px;\">||<div><img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/p3.jpg\" />||<ol start=\"10\">||<li>Then he recites the takbeer while raising his hands up to the level of the shoulders or a little above them, with the palms of his hands facing the qiblah, just as he has done upon reciting the first takbeer.||<li>Then he bows down, lowering his head and back and keeping them straight at a right angle, placing the palms of his hands on the knees. He says three times while in this position, called rukoo‛, Subhaana rabbiy-al-‛adheem (Glory be to my Lord, the Almighty). It is obligatory to say this only once, but it is recommended to say it three times. In the rukoo‛position, we must glorify and extoll Allah I.||<ul>||<li>This means declare Him free from all defects and to recognise His absolute perfection. He recites the words Subhaana rabbiyal-‛adheem, whilst bowing, in complete humility and in total submission to Almighty Allah.||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block-white bar\" style=\"width: 180px; height: 230px;\">||<div><img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/p4.jpg\" />||<ol start=\"12\">||<li>Then he resumes the standing position, raising his hands up to the level of the shoulders or a little above them, with the palms of his hands facing the qiblah, saying Sami‛allaahu li man hamidah (Allah listens to him who praises Him). He says this whether he is praying alone or is the prayer leader (imaam). Then each one says:Rabbanaa wa lakal-hamd (Our Lord, to You is due all praise). It is recommended to say after this: hamdan katheeran tayyiban mubaarakan feehi. Mil’assamaawaati wa mil’al-ardi wa mil’a maa shi’ta min shay’in ba‛d (An abundant, beautiful and blessed praise.

He is recommended not to bring the arms close to the sides nor the abdomen close to the thighs, making sure that his forearms are not in contact with the floor.||<li>He says in this position, called sujood, Subhaana rabbiyal-a‛laa (Glory be to my Lord, Most High). It is obligatory to say this only once, but it is recommended to say it three times. The prostrate position (sujood) is the noblest state where supplications must be made to Almighty Allah. Thus, after reciting the obligatory supplication mentioned above, a Muslim is recommended to invoke Allah and humbly and earnestly ask Him for anything in this life or in the hereafter which he wants. The prophet ﷺ said, “The nearest a servant can be to his Lord is when he prostrates himself in prayer. So invoke Allah much in this state.” (Saheeh Muslim: 482) Subhaana rabbiyal-a‛laa means: I declare Allah, Most High, the Almighty, above the heavens, free from all defects. This statement reminds the worshipper, who is humbly prostrating himself before Allah, of the difference between him and his Creator, Most High, prompting him to humbly submit to Him.||<ul>||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block-white bar\" style=\"width: 130px; height: 230px;\">||<div><img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/p6.jpg\" />||<ol start=\"15\">||<li>Then he recites the takbeer and sits between the two prostrations. He is recommended to sit on the left leg while keeping the right foot upright with the toes pointing towards the qiblah and resting his hands on his thighs close to the knees.||<ul>||<li>In fact, all the sitting postures during the prayer should be done in this way, except for the sitting posture where the final tashahhud is recited, in which case it is recommended to sit with the left buttock on the ground, the right foot placed vertically with the toes pointing towards the qiblah, and the left foot on its side emerging from underneath the right foot.||<li>If he cannot sit in this manner for the first tashahhud or the second one due to some knee pain or because he is not used to such postures, then he can sit in a similarly comfortable manner.||<ol start=\"16\">||<li>He says between the two prostrations: Rabbighfir lee, warhamnee, wahdinee, warzuqnee, wajburnee wa ‛aafinee (O Lord, forgive me, have mercy on me, guide me, provide for me, support me and protect me.).||<li>Then he recites the takbeer and prostrates himself in the same way as before. This completes one unit (rak‛ah) of the prayer.||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block-white bar\" style=\"width: 102px; height: 330px;\">||<div>\\r<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/p7.jpg\" />||<li>Then he rises to the standing position again, for the second unit, reciting the takbeer as he does so.||<li>He performs the second unit in exactly the same way as the first one.||<li>After the second prostration in the second unit, he takes a sitting posture and recites the first tashahhud: Attahiyyaatu lillaah, wassalawaatu wattayyibaat, assalaamu ‛alayka ayyuhannabiyyu wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuh, assalaamu ‛alaynaa wa ‛alaa ‛ibaad-illaah-issaaliheen, ash hadu an laa ilaaha illallaah, wa ash hadu anna Muhammadan ‛abduhu wa rasooluh (All reverence, all worship, all sanctity are due to Allah. Peace be on you, O Prophet, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings. Peace be on us and all the righteous servants of Allah. I bear witness that none is worthy of worship except Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and His Messenger.)||<li>Then he rises, reciting the takbeer, to assume a standing position and complete the rest of the prayer units if the prayer consists of three units (Maghrib) or four units (Dhuhr, ‛Asr and ‛Ishaa’). In the third and fourth units, however, he recites only Soorat Al-Faatihah. If the prayer consists of two units (Fajr), he recites the final tashahhud after completing the first tashahhud.||<ul>||<ol start=\"22\">||<li>||<p align=\"JUSTIFY\" dir=\"LTR\">||<span lang=\"FR\"><span lang=\"FR\"><span size=\"2\" style=\"font-size: small;\">In the last unit after the second prostration, he takes a sitting posture and recites the final tashahhud.

Then he turns his face to the left side and says the same thing. With these greetings he concludes his prayer, as the prophet ﷺ said, “The prayer begins with the takbeer and ends with the tasleem.” (Sunan Abu Daawood: 61, Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 3) The takbeer refers to the words Allaahu akbar (Allah is the greatest of all), and the tasleem refers to the words Assalaamu ‛alaykum wa rahmatullaah (Peace and mercy of Allah be on you). ||<ul start=\"24\">||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block-white bar\" style=\"width: 240px; height: 312px;\">||<div><img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/p8.jpg\" />||<ol start=\"24\">||<li>It is recommended that a Muslim recites the following supplications after completing any of the five obligatory daily prayers:<ol>||<li> Astaghfirullaah, (I seek Allah’s forgiveness) three times.||<li>Allaahumma antas-Salaam, wa mink-as-Salaam, tabaarakta yaa dhal-jalaali wal-ikraam (O Allah, You are Peace and from You comes peace.

Rabb (translated here ‘Lord’) refers to Almighty Allah, the Creator, Owner, Provider and Disposer of all affairs. The ‘worlds’ refers to anything apart from Allah ﷻ and includes, among other things, the world of human beings, that of the jinn, that of the angels and that of animals.||<p>Ar-Rahmaan-ir-Raheem “The Beneficent, the Merciful.” (1:3): Ar-Rahmaan (Most Beneficent) and Raheem (Most Merciful) are two of Allah’s names. Ar-Rahmaan is more intensive, in that Allah’s mercy includes in its objects the believers and the unbelievers, while Ar-Raheem has for its peculiar object the believers only.||<p>Maaliki yawmid-Deen “Master of the Day of Judgement.” (1:4): He is the only Judge on the Day of Judgement. This statement reminds the believers of the Last Day and prompts them to do righteous deeds.||<p>Iyyaaka na‛budu wa iyyaaka nasta‛een “You alone we worship. You alone we ask for help.” (1:5): We worship none but You, and we do not associate anyone with You in worship. We also seek only Your assistance and support in all our affairs, for the power of decision rests with you alone.||<p>Ihdinassiraat-al-mustaqeem “Guide us on the Straight Path.” (1:6): Show us to the Straight Path and help us adhere to it until we meet You. The Straight Path (as-siraat al-mustaqeem) is nothing but Islam, the clear religion that leads to Allah’s good pleasure and Paradise. It was Muhammad r, the Seal of Prophets, who guided us to it, and man’s happiness entirely depends on adhering to it.||<p>Siraatalladheena an‛amta ‛alayhim “The path of those You have blessed;” (1:7): That is, the path to which You have guided to, the prophets, the righteous people who know the truth and follow it.||<p>Ghayril maghdoobi ‛alayhim waladh-daalleen “not of those who have incurred Your wrath, nor of those who have gone astray.” (1:7): Keep us away from the path of those with whom You are angry because they know the truth but have chosen not to follow it, namely the Jews and their likes; also keep us away from the path of those who have not been guided to the truth due to their ignorance, namely the Christians and their likes.||<div id=\"div-box\" style=\"width: 100%;\">||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div>||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/prayer9.jpg\" />||<div class=\"dashed-box1\" style=\"float: left; width: 350px;\">||<h4>What Should a Person Who Does not Know Soorat Al-Faatihah and the Post-Obligatory Prayer Supplications by Heart Do?||<p>A new Muslim who does not know Soorat Al-Faatihah and the post-obligatory prayer supplications by heart must do the following:||<ul>||<li>He must do his best to memorise the obligatory supplications in the prayer, for the prayer will not be valid except by reciting these supplications in the Arabic language. These supplications are: Soorat Al-Faatihah, Allaahu akbar (Allah is Most Great), Subhaana rabbiy-al-‛adheem (Glory be to my Lord, the Almighty), Sami‛allaahu li man hamidah (Allah listens to him who praises Him), Rabbanaa wa lakal-hamd (Our Lord, to You is due all praise), Subhaana rabbiyal-a‛laa (Glory be to my Lord, Most High), Rabbighfir lee, (O Lord, forgive me), the first tashahhud, the final tashahhud, and Assalaamu ‛alaykum wa rahmatu llaah (Peace and mercy of Allah be on you).||<li>He must, before completing memorisation of these utterances, repeat, to the best of his ability, whatever of them he has committed to memory during the prayer and repeat whatever part of Soorat Al-Faatihah he has memorised, which is normally recited in the standing posture, for the Qur’an states, “Keep your duty to Allah as best you can.” (Soorat At-Taghaabun, 64:16)||<li>It is recommended that he attends the congregational prayers during this period so he can perfect his prayers and because the prayer leader (imaam) covers part of the shortcomings in the prayer of those praying behind him||",

It is the connection a Muslim establishes with his Lord and Creator and comprises the loftiest manifestations of total submissiveness to Allah, turning to Him and seeking His assistance and support. When a Muslim stands in prayer before his Lord, invokes and remembers Him, his mind becomes serene. He realises his true and deep sense of nothingness, the worthlessness and transitory nature of this life, and recognises the greatness of his Lord and the immense mercy He has shown him. This prayer then prompts him to adhere to the principles of the divine law and to shun injustice, indecency and wrongdoing, as the Qur’an states, “The prayer restrains from shameful and unjust deeds.” (Soorat Al-‛Ankaboot,29:45)||<p> ||<p>Position and Virtues of Salaat in Islam||<h3> ||<p>The prayer (salaat) is undeniably the greatest and most exalted act of worship. It is an act of worship which engages not only the body but also the heart, the mind and the tongue. Its immeasurable significance can be perceived in a number of aspects including the following:||<p> ||<p>It Occupies theLoftiest Position in Islam||<h4> ||<ol>||<li>||<p>It is the second pillar of Islam, as the prophet ﷺ said, “Islam has been built on five [pillars]: Testifying that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, performing the prayers, paying the zakaat, making the pilgrimage to the House, and fasting in Ramadaan.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 8; Saheeh Muslim: 16) These pillars are the foundations upon which Islam is firmly established, and a pillar is a post that is used to support a building, without which it will certainly collapse.||<li>||<p>Textual evidence from the Qur’an and the Prophet’s traditions considers performance of the prayer to be the act which distinguishes Muslims from non-Muslims. The prophet ﷺ said, “What makes a person become an unbeliever or a polytheist is his abandonment of the prayer.” (SaheehAl-Bukhaaree: 8; Saheeh Muslim: 16) He also said, “The criterion between us and the polytheists is performance of the prayer. Thus, whoever abandons it is an unbeliever.” (Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 2621; Sunan An-Nasaa’ee: 463)||<li>Allah ﷻ commands the believers to perform it under all circumstances—whether travelling or residing, in times of war and peace, and whether one is sick or in good health, according to their ability. The Qur’an says, “Strictly observe the prayers.” (Soorat Al-baqarah, 2:238). Almighty Allah describes His faithful servants as those “who consistently observe the prayers.” (Soorat Al-Mu’minoon, 23:9)||<h3>It Has Numerous Virtues||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 260px; height: 300px;\">||<caption> Allah ﷻ commands the believers to observe the prayers under all circumstances, even in times of war and disasters. .||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/prayer2.jpg\" />||<p>Textual evidence from the Qur’an and the Prophet’s traditions attest to the numerous virtues of the prayer. The following are some of them:||<ol>||<li>It wipes off the minor sins, as the prophet ﷺ said, “The five daily prayers and the Friday prayer to the next Friday prayer wipe off whatever minor sins may be committed in between, so long as the major sins are avoided.”(Saheeh Muslim: 233; Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 214)||<li>It is a light that enlightens a Muslim’s life, guides him to all that is good and keeps him away from evil, as the Qur’an states, “The prayer restrains from shameful and unjust deeds.”(Soorat Al-‛Ankaboot, 29:45) The prophet ﷺ also said, “The prayer is a light.” (Saheeh Muslim: 223)||<li>It will be the first act people will be questioned about on the Day of Judgement: If it is accepted, the rest of their acts will be accepted; if, however, it is not accepted, none of the other acts will be accepted, as the prophet ﷺ said, “The first act that the servant of Allah will be accountable for on the Day of Judgement will be his prayers. If they are good, the rest of his acts will be good. But if they are bad, the rest of his acts will be bad.” (At-Tabaraanee’s Al-Mu‛jam Al-Awsat: 1859)||<div id=\"note\">The sweetest moments a believer experiences is during the prayer, for when he engages in making humble and devout supplication to his Lord, he experiences peace and tranquillity in His presence. Indeed, it was the greatest joy for the prophet ﷺ who once observed, “The prayer is the source of my greatest joy.” (Sunan An-Nasaa’ee: 3940) He would even ask Bilaal t, his caller to the prayer, to call the prayer so he would experience spiritual peace and tranquillity. “Call [the people] to prayer, Bilaal,” he would say to him. “Let us be comforted by it.” (Sunan Abu Daawood: 4985) Also, whenever something distressed him, he would turn to prayer. (Sunan Abu Daawood: 1319)||<h3>For Whom Is It Obligatory?||<p>It is obligatoryfor every adult, sane and responsible Muslim, male or female to offer the prayer. However, menstruating women or women in their post-natal bleeding are exempt from offering the prayers and are not required to make up for the prayers they have missed after their bleeding ceases and they have purified themselves||<h3>Maturity or puberty can be determined by the following indicators:||<table style=\"width: 50%;\">||<tbody>||<tr>||<td>Turning fifteen</td>||</tr>||<tr>||<td>Appearance of pubic hair</td>||</tr>||<tr>||<td>Seminal discharge while sleeping or when awake</td>||</tr>||<tr>||<td>Menstruation and conception (for women)</td>||</tr>||</tbody>||</table>",

It is true that it is a stone structure which can do neither harm nor good, but Allah ﷻ commands the Muslims to face it during the prayer to serve as a focal and unifying point among them.||<li>A Muslim is required to face the Ka‛bah if he can see it in front of him. However, if he is far away from it and cannot see it, being in a different country, for instance, he can only face Makkah. The prayer is still considered valid with slight deviation from the direction of the qiblah, for the prophet ﷺ said, “Whatever is between the east and the west is the qiblah.” (Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 342)||<li>If he cannot possibly face it due to illness, for instance, then he does not have to do so, for all obligatory acts are normally dropped in case of inability, as the Qur’an states, “Therefore, do your duty towards Allah to the best of your ability.” (Soorat At-Taghaabun, 64:16)||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"4\">When its Appointed time Becomes Due||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 220px; height: 260px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/prayer5.jpg\" />||<p>The prayer will not be valid if it is offered before its time has started, and delaying it beyond its designated time is strictly forbidden, as the Qur’an states, “The prayers are enjoined on the believers at stated times.” (Soorat An-Nisaa’,4:103)||<p>The following facts must be stressed regarding this point:||<p class=\"style1\"> ||<ul>||<li>It is better to offer the prayer as soon as its actual time becomes due.||<li>It must be offered at its stated times||<li>If a prayer is missed due to sleep or forgetfulness, it must be made up for as soon as it is remembered.||",

        "body3": "<h2> The Five Obligatory Prayers and Their Times||<p>Allah ﷻ has enjoined upon Muslims five prayers throughout the day and night and has specified the following times for them:||<p>The Dawn Prayer (Salaat-ul-Fajr): It consists of two units (rak‛aat, singular: rak‛ah); it begins at daybreak, the time of day when light first appears, and lasts until sunrise.||<p>The Afternoon Prayer (Salaat-udh-Dhuhr): It consists of four units; its time begins when the sun declines westward from the middle of the sky and ends when the shadow of an object becomes equal in length to the object itself plus the length of its shadow when the sun was at its zenith.||<p>The Late Afternoon Prayer (Salaat-ul-‛Asr): It consists of four units; its time begins after the time of Dhuhr ends and ends with the setting of the sun. Hence, if the shadow of an object becomes equal to the length of that object plus its length when the sun was at its zenith, then the time of Dhuhr ends and the ‛Asr time begins. A Muslim must perform it before the sun loses some of its intensity and turns yellow.||<p>The Sunset Prayer (Salaat-ul-Maghrib): It consists of three units; its time begins with sunset, that is, when the sun disappears below the horizon and finishes with the disappearance of the red glow (evening twilight) in the western horizon.||<p>The Late Evening Prayer (Salaat-ul-‛Ishaa’): It consists of four units; its time begins when the twilight has completely faded away and lasts until midnight. It could be offered, however, a little before dawn, if need be, and the reason is acceptable in Islam.||<p class=\"dashed-box1\">A Muslim may use prayer timetables and does not have to find out if the prayer appointed time has become due by himself.",
        "title4": "The Place of Prayer",
        "body4": "<h2> The Place of Prayer||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 260px; height: 220px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/prayer6.jpg\" />||<p>Islam commands men to perform congregational prayers and encourages them to do so in the mosque, which provides a social forum for Muslims. Congregational prayers help increase and strengthen the bonds of brotherhood, unity and togetherness between them. In fact, Islam promises greater rewards for those who join the congregational prayers, as the prophet ﷺ said, “The reward for a prayer a man offers in congregation is twenty-seven times greater than that for a prayer he offers by himself.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 619, Saheeh Muslim: 650, and Musnad Ahmad: 5921)||<p>The prayer can, however, be performed anywhere. This reflects one of the favours Allah ﷻ has bestowed upon us, making this religion easy and practical. The prophet ﷺ said, “The earth has been made a place of prayer for me, and it is pure (i.e. suitable for performing tayammum when there is no water available or when one is unable to use it). Therefore, anyone from my community who is overtaken by the time of prayer can pray wherever they may be.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 328; Saheeh Muslim: 521)||<h3>Criteria That Must Be Met Regarding the Place of Prayer||<p>Islam stipulates that the place where we intend to offer the prayer must be pure and clean, as the Qur’an states, “We commanded Abraham and Ishmael: ‘Purify My House for those who walk round it, those who stay there, and those who bow and prostrate themselves in worship.’”(Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2:125) As a general rule, wherever we intend to pray must be clean and pure unless it is clear beyond any doubt that it has been smeared by some impurity. Therefore, if there is nothing that might otherwise render a place impure, it must be considered clean, and we are allowed to offer our prayer on it without the need of using a prayer mat.||<p>There are a number of criteria and conditions that must be met regarding the place where we intend to pray, and they include the following:||<ol>||<li>One must not pray in a place where he may disturb people, such as busy public areas, passageways and places where one is not allowed to stand or sit, as this can lead to crowdedness and cause a great deal of inconvenience. The prophet ﷺ said, “There should be neither harming, nor reciprocating harm.” (Sunan Ibn Maajah: 2340, Musnad Ahmad: 2865)||<li>The place must be free from things which may otherwise cause distraction, such as pictures (like the ones found on some prayer mats), loud noises and music.||<li>One must not pray in a place where worship is ridiculed, such as a place where there are drunken people or fanatics. Almighty Allah forbids Muslims to abuse the false deities of non-Muslims so that they may not in revenge abuse Allah ﷻ in their ignorance: “Do not insult those they call upon besides Allah in case that makes them insult Allah in animosity, without knowledge .” (Soorat Al-An‛aam, 6:108)||<li>One must not pray in a place specifically designed for committing sinful acts, such as ballrooms and nightclubs.||<p> ||<h2> The Place of Prayer||<div id=\"left-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 100px; height: 480px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/prayer7.jpg\" />||",

If any of these pillars is left out due to forgetfulness or deliberate omission, the prayer becomes invalid.||<p>They are as follows:||<p>The opening takbeer; assuming the standing position, if one has the ability to do so; reciting Soorat Al-Faatihah (in the case of performing the prayer alone, i.e., not being led by an imaam); bowing; rising from the bowing position; prostrating, sitting between the two prostrations, the final tashahhud, sitting while reciting the tashahhud; the tasleem.; and making certain that each body part assumes the appropriate position before one moves from one position to another.||<p>The obligatory acts of the prayer (waajibaat; singular: waajib)are those acts that must be done in the prayer. If they are deliberately omitted, the prayer becomes invalid. However, if they are left out due to inattention or forgetfulness, the prayer is still valid, but the acts that are left out can be compensated for with the two prostrations of forgetfulness, as will be explained later.||<h3>The obligatory acts of the prayer are as follows:||<p>Recitation of takbeer throughout the prayer other than the opening takbeer; saying Subhaana rabbiy-al-‛adheem (Glory be to my Lord, the Almighty) once; saying Sami‛allaahu li man hamidah (Allah listens to him who praises Him), whether one is praying alone or one is the prayer leader (imaam); saying Rabbanaa wa lakal-hamd (Our Lord, to You is due all praise); Subhaana rabbiyal-a‛laa (Glory be to my Lord, Most High) once; saying Rabbighfir lee, (O Lord, forgive me) while sitting between the two prostrations once; and reciting the first tashahhud. These obligatory acts can be made up for with the two prostrations of forgetfulness.||<p>The recommended acts of the prayer (sunan as-salaat) are those words and acts other than the pillars nor the obligatory acts of the prayer. They serve to complement the prayer and it is recommended to observe them. Omission of any of these acts, however, does not render the prayer invalid.||<div id=\"dotted-box\">||<h2>The Two Prostrations of Forgetfulness||<p>These prostrations are generally performed to make up for any deficiency in the prayer.||<h4>When can they be performed?||<p>They can be performed in the following cases:||<ol>||<li>If a person forgetfully adds an extra act in the prayer, whether it is assuming an extra standing position, prostrate position, bowing position or sitting position, then he has to perform the two prostrations of forgetfulness at the end of the prayer.||<li>If he unintentionally leaves out any of the pillars of the prayer (arkaan), he must add the missing pillar and then perform the two prostrations of forgetfulness at the end of the prayer.||<li>If he unintentionally leaves out any of the obligatory acts of prayer (waajibaat), such as the first tashahhud, he must perform the prostrations of forgetfulness.||<li>If he is in doubt as to the number of the prayer units he has performed, he simply assumes he has performed the lesser number to be on the safe side and performs the two prostrations of forgetfulness at the end of the prayer.||<p>Manner of Performing the Two Prostrations due to Forgetfulness: These can be performed in exactly the same manner he normally performs in the prayer; that is, by performing two prostrations and sitting between them.||<p>When to Perform the Two Prostrations of Forgetfulness: They can be performed:||<ul>||<li>After the final tashahhud and before reciting the tasleem, he performs the two prostrations of forgetfulness and then recites the tasleem as he normally does to conclude the prayer.||<li>After reciting the tasleem, he performs the two prostrations of forgetfulness and then recites the tasleem again.||",

They are as follows:||<ol>||<li>Turning the head around during prayer, for when the prophet ﷺ was asked about this act, he said, “It is a way of stealing by which Satan takes away a portion from a person’s prayer.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 718)||<li>Fiddling with one’s hands or face, placing one’s hands on the hips, clasping one’s hands together and cracking one’s fingers.||<li>Engaging in prayer when one is distracted by something, such as one’s need to answer the call of nature, for the prophet ﷺ said, “No prayer can be correctly offered when the food is served before the worshipper, or when one is prompted by the call of nature.” (Saheeh Muslim: 560)||<p> ",
        "title3": "The Recommended Voluntary Prayers",
        "body3": "<h2> The Recommended Voluntary Prayers||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 260px; height: 200px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/prayer12.jpg\" />||<p>Muslims are required to offer only five prayers a day.||<p>However, Islam encourages them to offer other recommended prayers, for doing so makes them worthy of Allah’s love and serve to make up for any deficiencies in the performance of the obligatory prayers.||<p class=\"style2\">The following are some of the most important supererogatory prayers:||<ol>||<li>The Supererogatory Prayers Accompanying the Obligatory Prayers (As-Sunan Ar-Rawaatib): These are the prayers that are offered before or after the obligatory prayers and Muslims generally do not neglect them. Regarding the reward for performing these prayers, the prophet ﷺ said, “Allah will build a house in Paradise for any Muslim who prays twelve units of voluntary prayer during the night and day.” (Saheeh Muslim: 728) They are as follows||<table style=\"width: 61%;\">||<tbody>||<tr>||<td style=\"width: 32px;\">1</td>||<td>Two units before the Fajr prayer</td>||</tr>||<tr>||<td style=\"width: 32px;\">2</td>||<td>Four units before the Dhuhr prayer, reciting the tasleem after each two units; and two other units after the Dhuhr prayer</td>||</tr>||<tr>||<td style=\"width: 32px;\">3</td>||<td>Two units after the Maghrib prayer</td>||</tr>||<tr>||<td style=\"width: 32px;\">4</td>||<td>Two units after the ‛Ishaa’ prayer</td>||</tr>||</tbody>||</table>||<ol start=\"2\">||<li>The Witr Prayer: the Arabic word witr means “odd number” and refers to odd-numbered prayer offered after the ‛Ishaa’ prayer. It is considered to be one of the best and most meritorious of all supererogatory prayers. The prophet ﷺ once commanded the Muslims, “Followers of the Qur’an! Perform the witr prayer.” (Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 453, Sunan Ibn Maajah: 1170)||<p>The best time to offer the witr prayer is in the later part of the night before the Fajr prayer, but a Muslim may perform it at any time between the Ishaa’ and the Fajr prayers. The minimum number of units for the witr prayer is one, but it is better to offer three. A Muslim may offer more if he wishes, but the maximum number of units which the Prophet r used to perform was eleven. The units of the supererogatory prayers are generally offered two by two, followed by the tasleem. The witr prayer is no exception. However, if a Muslim wants to conclude his prayer, he must add one single unit, during which he may recite a special supplication, known as qunoot supplication. This supplication is recited after rising from the bowing position and before prostrating. After this supplication, he may pray to Allah and ask Him for whatever he wishes, holding his hands in front of him with both palms up.||<h3>Times During Which It Is Not Permissible to Offer the Supererogatory Prayers||<p>A Muslim may offer a supererogatory prayer at any time, except at such times during which it is prohibited to offer them, as they are generally times specified for prayers offered by some non-Muslims. During these times, he is only allowed to make up for the obligatory prayers he may have missed or the supererogatory prayers which are offered for a reason, such as the prayer of tahiyyatul-masjid, ‘‘greeting the mosque”, a prayer which consists of two units and is performed upon entering the mosque and there is enough time to perform it before the obligatory prayer commences. A Muslim may, however, invoke Allah and recite supplications at any time.||<p class=\"style2\">These times are as follows:||<table style=\"width: 79%;\">||<tbody>||<tr>||<td style=\"width: 14px;\">1</td>||<td>From the time following the Fajr prayer until the sunrises above the horizon by the length of a spear, a short period of time specified in Islamic Law and is equal to approximately twenty minutes in countries with a temperate climate.</td>||</tr>||<tr>||<td style=\"width: 14px;\">2</td>||<td>From the time the sun is at its zenith until it declines westward from the middle of the sky.

Mentioning the reward of the congregational prayer, the prophet ﷺ once said, “The reward for a prayer offered in congregation is twenty-seven times greater than that offered by a person alone.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 619; Saheeh Muslim: 650)||<p>The congregational prayer can be established by at least two people, one of them acts as the prayer leader (imaam). However, the larger the congregation, the dearer it is to Allah.||<h4>Following the Imam in Prayer||<p>This means that those praying behind the imaam must do the same as he does during the prayer by observing all the prayer movements and taking all the prayer postures, such as bowing and prostrating, immediately after him. They must not engage in any movement or posture before him or differ with him in this respect in anything whatsoever.||<p>The prophet ﷺ said, “The imaam is to be followed. Say Allaahu akbar when he says it, and do not say it until he says it first. Bow when he bows, and do not bow until he has done so first. When he says, sami‛-Allaahu liman hamidah (Allah listens to him who praises Him),’ say, “Rabbanaa wa lak-al-hamd (Our Lord, to You is due all praise).’ Prostrate when he prostrates, and do not prostrate until he has done so first” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 710, Saheeh Muslim: 414 and Sunan Abu Daawood: 603)||<h3>Who Should Lead the Prayer?||<p>Generally speaking, the person who knows the Qur’an the best should be given preference in leading the prayer. If those present are equal in that respect, then the one who is best informed in the rules of religion , as the prophet ﷺ said, “ Let him act as imaam to a congregation who knows the Qur’an by heart the best; and if all present should be equal in that respect, then let him perform who has the deepest knowledge of the Sunnah…”(Saheeh Muslim: 673)||<h3>Where Does the Imaam and Those He Leads Standin Prayer?||<p>The imaam stands in front of those he leads in prayer (ma’moomoon; singular: ma’moom /follower). The followers, standing shoulder to shoulder, form straight lines behind him, and the front rows should be filled and completed first. If there is only one follower (ma’moom), he positions himself to the right of the imaam.||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 170px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/prayer15.jpg\" />||<h3>How to Make up for Missed Prayer Units||<p>If the prayer has already started, the latecomer should join in the congregation in the very position in which he finds the imaam. For example, if he finds the imaam in the prostrate position, he must recite the takbeer and then prostrate himself. When the imaam concludes the congregational prayer by reciting the tasleem, the latecomer rises, reciting the takbeer, to assume a standing position and complete the rest of the prayer individually, by making up for the units he has missed.||<p>The unit (rak‛ah) that he catches up with the imaam when he first joins the congregation counts as the beginning of his own prayer, and whatever he makes up for after the imaam concludes the congregational prayer counts as the rest of his prayer.||<h3>How to Determine that a Complete Rak‛ah Is Offered||<p>The prayer is determined by the number of units offered in it; if a latecomer joins the congregation while the imaam is in the bowing position, he is considered to have offered a complete unit (rak‛ah) even though he has not recited Soorat Al- Faatihah in that particular rak‛ah in the standing position. If, however, he misses the bowing position, then he mus trecite the takbeer and join the congregation. In this case, he is considered to have missed this particular rak‛ah and whatever movements and postures in it do not count.||<h4>Examples Illustrating Ways of Making up for Missed Prayer Units||<p class=\"dashed-box1\">If someone joins the congregation during the Fajr prayer while the imaam is in the second rak‛ah, he must, after the imaam concludes the prayer with the tasleem, rise, reciting the takbeer, to assume a standing position and make up for the other rak‛ah which he has missed. He must not recite the tasleem until he completes the prayer, for the Fajr prayer consists of two units and he has only offered one unit with the imaam.||<p class=\"dashed-box2\">If he joins the congregation during the Maghrib prayer while the imaam is in the sitting position reciting the final tashahhud, he must, after the imaam concludes the prayer with the tasleem, rise, reciting the takbeer, to assume a standing position and offer three complete units of prayer. The reason for this is that he has joined the congregation only at its end while the imaam is reciting the final tashahhud. A unit (rak‛ah) only counts as complete if one joins the congregation while the imaam is in the bowing posture.||<p class=\"dashed-box3\">If he joins the congregation during the Dhuhr prayer while the imaam is in the bowing position of the third rak‛ah, then this means that he has offered two complete units of prayer, which count for him as his two first units. As soon as the imaam concludes the prayer with the tasleem, he must then rise, reciting the takbeer, to assume a standing position and offer two more units, namely the third and fourth units, considering that the Dhuhr prayer consists of four units of prayer.",

Another call, called the iqaamah, serves the purpose of summoning Muslims to line up for the beginning of the obligatory prayers. Muslims used to meet up and seek to know the time of prayer, but no one summoned them. One day they were discussing how to gather everyone for prayer.||<p>Some suggested using a bell as the Christians do, and others recommended using a ram’s horn, following an ancient Jewish practice. Then ‛Umar ibn Al-Khattaab t, one of the Prophet’s companions, suggested appointin gsomeone to call people to prayer. The Prophet agreed, so he turned to Bilal t, and said, “Get up, Bilaal, and call the people to prayer.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 579; Saheeh Muslim: 377)||<h3>The Manner of Reciting the Adhaan and the Iqaamah||<ul>||<li>Both the adhaan and the iqaamah must be recited in the case of a group of people (congregation) but it is not the case with an individual. If a congregation intentionally leave it out, their prayer will still be valid but they will be considered sinners.||<li>The adhaan ought to be recited in a nice and loud voice so people can hear it and come to the mosque and perform the congregational prayer.||<li>The adhaan has different formulas, all approved by the prophet ﷺ.

By keeping such distractions away, one develops a serene mind ||that paves the way for better concentration in this great act of worship ||one is about to offer. || <ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"3\">Tuma’neenah ||<p>Tuma’neenah has no equivalent in English, and it generally means ||avoiding haste and not moving from one posture to another until it has ||lasted at leastthe time that it took for the bones to settle.The prophet ﷺ ||never offered his prayer hurriedly. He would perform all the prayer ||postures and movements perfectly and would not move from one posture to ||another until it lasted at least the time that it took for the bones to ||settle. He would also order those of his companions who rushed their ||prayers to take their time in all the prayer postures and movements and to ||complete them properly. He did not like them to rush it and compared the ||act of hurriedly offering the prayer to that of the pecking of crows. ||<p>He once said to his companions, “The worst kind of thief is one who ||steals from his prayer.” They asked him, “How can someone steal from this ||prayer?” He replied, “By not completing its bowing and prostrate postures ||properly.” (Musnad Ahmad: 22642) ||<p>Those who rush their prayer cannot possibly offer it withdeep ||concentration and total humility before Almighty Allah, for haste ||undoubtedly affects attentiveness and humility in prayer, reducing one’s ||rewards. || <ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"4\">Contemplating Allah’s Greatness ||<p>We must contemplate the greatness of the Creator, recognising His ||perfection and acknowledging one’s own weaknessesand defects. Those who ||contemplate the greatness of Allah cannot help but notice that they are ||rather worthless by comparison. This increases their reverence of Allah ||and makes them invoke Allah and humbly and earnestly ask Him for anything. ||We must also remember the eternal bliss Allah ﷻ has prepared for the ||obedient believers and the severe punishment He has prepared for the ||unbelievers. We also must think about the day when we will stand before ||Allah for the final judgement. Allah ﷻ mentions in the Qur’an that those ||who do so are indeed those who are certain they will meet Him: “Seek ||Allah’s help with patient perseverance and prayer; and truly it is a very ||hard thing except for the humble, those who know that they will have to ||meet their Lord, and that to Him they are returning.” (Soorat Al-Baqarah, ||2:45-6) The more conscious awareness we have that Allah can hear us, give ||us and respond to our prayers, the more humbleness we develop and the more ||we will contemplate Allah’s greatness. ||<p> || <ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"5\">Meditating on the Qur’anic Verses and Other ||Prayer Utterances and Responding to Them ||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\" width:200px; height:230px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/prayer19.jpg\"/>||<p>The Qur’an was revealed to be reflected on, as the Qur’an states, “It ||is a Book We have sent down to you, full of blessing, so let people of ||intelligence ponder its signs and take heed.” (Soorat Saad, 38:29) This ||cannot be possibly achieved without understanding the meaning of the ||invocations, supplications and Qur’anic verses recited in prayer. ||Meditation on the meaning of what one recites as well as on one’s own ||condition is bound to increase one’s concentration and humility in prayer ||and even move one to tears and ecstasy. Such emotional effect becomes ||evident with every verse to which they listen, as the Qur’an states, ||“Those who, when they are reminded of the verses of their Lord, they do ||not turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to them.” (Soorat Al-Furqaan,25:73) ||<p> ||<p>||",

It is one of the most exalted Islamic rituals and one of its confirmed obligatory acts. On this day, Muslims gather once a week, listen to the sermon which the imaam delivers, and then offer the Friday prayer.||<h3>Virtues of Friday||<p>Friday is the best and most exalted day of the week, for Allah ﷻ has favoured it over other days due to a number of virtues including the following:||<ul>||<li> Allah ﷻ has specifically chosen it for the Muslims, as the prophet ﷺ said, “Allah led those who came before us away from Friday. The Jews had Saturday, and the Christians had Sunday. Then Allah brought us and Allah guided us to Friday.” (Saheeh Muslim: 856)||<li>Allah created Adam on it, and on this very day the Day of Judgement will take place, as the prophet ﷺ said, “Friday is the best day on which the sun rises. On this day, Adam was created; on it he was admitted into Paradise and on it he was turned out of it. The Day of Judgement will also take place on Friday.” (Saheeh Muslim: 854)||<h3>Who Must Perform the Friday Prayer?||<p>The Friday prayer is a religious obligation that is binding on those who meet these conditions:||<ol>||<li>They must be men: Women do not have to offer it.||<li>They must be legally accountable (mukallaf ) for their actions: It is not obligatory for insane or children who have not reached puberty.||<li>They must be resident: It is not obligatory for travellers or those who live in the countryside, outside towns and cities.||<h3>The Friday Prayer: Manner and Rulings||<ol>||<li>It is recommended that a Muslim should take a ritual bath (ghusl), wear nice and clean clothes and proceed early to the mosque.||<li>Muslims gather in the mosque. The imaam mounts the pulpit (minbar), faces the worshippers and delivers the khutbah (sermon), which normally consists of two sections, between which he sits briefly. In this sermon, he reminds them of being conscious of Allah, offers them advice, preaches to them and recites to them verses from the Qur’an.||<li>Muslims must listen attentively to the khutbah. They are not allowed to engage in talking or do anything which will otherwise deprive them of benefiting from the khutbah, even if it is fiddling with the carpet, stones or sand.||<li>The imaam then descends from the pulpit, takes his position and leads the people in a two-rak’ah prayer in which he recites the Qur’an aloud.||<li>The Friday prayer can only be performed if a certain number of people are present. If any person misses it for a valid reason, he cannot make up for it; and if he offers it on his own, it will not be valid. Instead, he must offer the daily afternoon prayer (salaat-udh-Dhuhr).||<li>If a person comes late to the mosque and catches up with the imaam in less than one unit (rak‛ah), he must complete his prayer after the imaam concludes the prayer, treating it as the afternoon prayer (salaat-udh-Dhuhr).||<li>Those who are exempt from offering the Friday prayer, such as women and travellers, do not have to offer the daily afternoon prayer (salaat-udh-Dhuhr) if they have already performed the Friday prayer in the mosque||<h3>Those who Are Exempt from Attending the Friday Prayer||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 270px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/prayer21.jpg\" />||<p>Islam stresses that Muslims who are not exempt from offering the Friday prayer must perform it and warns them against occupying themselves with worldly pursuits: “O you who believe, when the call is proclaimed to prayer on Friday, hasten earnestly to the remembrance of Allah and leave off business and traffic. That is best for you if you only knew ” (Soorat Al-Jumu‛ah, 62:9) It also warns that Allah will set a seal on the hearts of those who miss it without a valid excuse, as the prophet ﷺ said, “Allah will seal up the hearts of those whomiss three Friday prayers consecutively, out of sheer negligence and without an excuse.” (Sunan Abu Daawood: 1052; Musnad Ahmad: 15498) This means that He will cover their hearts and place ignorance in them, just like the hearts of hypocrites and disobedient people. An excuse that is considered genuinely valid for missing a Friday prayer is one which involves unusually great hardship or one which is bound to cause serious harm to one’s health or is detrimental to one’s livelihood. .||<h3>Can a career that requires one to work at the time of the Friday prayer be considered a valid excuse to miss it?||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 190px;\">||<caption> “Say, ‘What is with Allah is better than trade or entertainment.’” (Soorat Al-Jumu‛ah, 62:11)||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/prayer22.jpg\" />||<p> ||<p>Generally, taking up careers that require one to carry on working at the time of the Friday prayer is not a valid excuse for missing the Friday prayer, for Allah ﷻ commands us to leave our worldly pursuits when we are called to the Friday prayer: “O you who believe, when the call is proclaimed to prayer on Friday, hasten earnestly to the remembrance of Allah and leave off business and traffic.” (Soorat Al-Jumu‛ah, 62:9)Therefore, a Muslim is required to take up jobs that will not prevent him from observing religious obligations even if such jobs are with less pay. The Qur’an also states, “For those who fear Allah, He ever prepares a way out, and He provides for him from sources he never could imagine. And if any one puts his trust in Allah, sufficient is Allah for him.” (Soorat At-Talaaq, 65:2-3)||<div id=\"dotted-box\">||<h4>When Can a Career Be Considered a Valid Excuse to Miss the Friday Prayer?||<p>Careers which require us to carry on working during the time of the Friday prayer can only be considered a valid excuse in the following two cases:||<ol>||<li>Such a career must provide a great benefit which cannot be possibly realised if a person leaves the job and attends the Friday prayer. By the same token, leaving it will certainly cause great harm, especially when there is no one else to replace him.||<div class=\"dashed-box4\" style=\"background: #FFF9F0;\">Examples: :||<ul>||<li> Doctors who treat emergency cases.||<li> Guards or police officers who protect people and their property from theft and criminal activity.||<li>People who hold supervisory positions in large firms and the like which require constant supervision.||<ol start=\"2\">||<li>If such a career is the sole source of income which covers his basic expenses, such as food, drink and other necessary matters, for him and his family, then he may not attend the Friday prayer and may continue his work until he finds an alternative job or until he finds a source of food, drink and necessary matters that are sufficient for himself and his dependents. However, he must keep looking for another source of income.||",

As the Qur’an states, “O you who believe, fasting has been prescribed for you, just as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may become righteous <em>(Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2:183)</em>||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"2\">It provides ample training in refraining from sin and wrongdoing||<p>When a fasting person desistsfrom engaging in permissible acts, in total obedience to Allah, he will certainly be able to bring his whims and desires under control, easily avoid sins and will not persist in falsehood and deviation from the truth. The Prophet ﷺ said, “A person who does not desist form deceitful speech and actions [while fasting] must know that Allah is not in need of him leaving his food and drink.”<em> (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 1804)</em> This means that those who do not desist from telling lies and deceiving others do not actually perceive the purpose of fasting.||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"3\">It helps us remember the needy and the distressed and encourages us to sympathise with them||<p>Because the fasting person experiences the pangs of deprivation and hunger, which are only temporary, he realises the severe effects of such pains on his fellow Muslim brothers and sisters who might be deprived of the essentials of life for a long time and undergo extreme hunger and thirst. This prompts him to feel more compassion for them and help them.",

        "body3": "<h3>Virtues of Fasting||<p>Fasting has numerous virtues including the following:||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 220px; height: 190px;\">||<caption>Ramadaan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/dates.jpg\" width=\"220\" />||<ol>||<li>A person who fasts during this month, sincerely believing in Allah, in obedience to His commands and is certain of His rewards in the hereafter for doing so, will have all his past sins forgiven. The Prophet ﷺ said, “Whoever fasts in the month of Ramadaan, out of sincere faith and in anticipation of Allah’s rewards [in the hereafter], will have all his past sins forgiven.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 1910; Saheeh Muslim: 760)||<li>The fasting person will experience great joy in the hereafter for the great rewards he will get and the bliss he will enjoy for fasting. The Prophet ﷺ said, “The fasting person has two moments of joy: one when he breaks his fast and the other one when he meets his Lord.” <em>(Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 1805; Saheeh Muslim: 1151)</em>||<li>Paradise has a gate called Ar-Rayyaan through which only those who used to fast will enter, as the Prophet ﷺ said, “In Paradise there is a gate called Ar-Rayyaan, through which only those who fast will enter on the Day of Resurrection, and no one but they will enter it. It will be said, ‘Where are those who fasted?’ They will then get up, and none will enter it but them. When they have entered, it will be closed, and no one else will enter.” <em>(Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 1797; Saheeh Muslim: 1152)</em>||<li>Every act of worship has a certain reward except for fasting, for which Allah, in His boundless bounty and mercy, will reward those who observe it abundantly. The Prophet ﷺ said, “Allah said, ‘All the deeds of the children of Adam are for them except for fasting, which is for Me, and I will reward it.’”<em>(Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 1805, Saheeh Muslim: 1151)</em>||",
        "title4": "Things which Break the Fast",
        "body4": "<h3>Things which Break the Fast||<p>A fasting person must avoid a number of things which are bound to break the fast. They are as follows:||<ol>||<li>Food and drink, as the Qur’an states, “Eat and drink until you can clearly discern the white thread from the black thread of the dawn, then strictly observe the fast until nightfall.” <em>(Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2:187)</em>\\r However, if a person forgets that he is fasting and so he eats or drinks, his fast is still valid and he is not considered sinful for absent-mindedly doing so. The Prophet ﷺ said, “Whoever forgets he is fasting and so he eats or drinks, let him complete his fast for it is Allah who has fed him and given him to drink.” <em>(Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 1831; Saheeh Muslim: 1155)</em>||<li>Anything that is classified as being in some way similar to eating and drinking. This includes the following:||<ul>||<li>Injections which have some nutritional value: These serve to supply the body with the necessary minerals and nutrients it needs, hence their similarity to eating and drinking.||<li>Having a blood transfusion: Blood is like the body’s transportation system, and as it circulates, it delivers oxygen and nutrients throughout the body, hence its resemblance to eating and drinking.||<li>Smoking in all its forms renders the fast void, for inhaling smoke introduces numerous toxic substances into the body.||<ol>||<li value=\"3\">Sexual activity in which a man puts his penis into a woman’s vagina, whether or not this results in ejaculation.||<li>Deliberate seminal emission through sexual contact, masturbation or any other means.||<p>However, wet dreams, sexually exciting dreams) that result in an orgasm, do not break the fast.\\r A man may kiss his wife if he knows he can easily control himse lf and does not engage in intercourse or any act that may lead to seminal emission.||<ol>||<li value=\"5\">Deliberate vomiting: Involuntary vomiting, however, does not the break the fast. The Prophet ﷺ said, “If a person vomits unintentionally while observing a fast, he does not have to make up for this by fasting another day; however, if he deliberately vomits, then he must fast another day for breaking his [obligatory] fast.” <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 720; Sunan Abu Daawood: 2380)</em>||<li>Beginning of menstruation or post-natal bleeding regardless of the time or part of the day when such bleeding begins.Whenever such bleeding begins, even if it takes place just before sunset, a woman’s fast is automatically broken. If a menstruating woman becomes clean after dawn, her fast is also broken. The Prophet ﷺ said, “Isn’t it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?”<em>(Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 1850)</em>||<p>Nevertheless, apart from menstrual bleeding and post-natal bleeding, abnormal uterine bleeding which some women experience does not prevent them from fasting.",

They must, however, make up for the fast days they have missed after Ramadaan..||<h3>The Islamic Ruling Regarding Those who Deliberately Break the Fast||<p>||<p>Breaking the fast without a valid excuse is a grave sin which clearly testifies to its doer’s disobedience to Allah ﷻ. Therefore, those who commit such a sin must sincerely repent to Allah in addition to making up for the fast days they have omitted. Those who engage in sexual intercourse during the day in Ramadaan must, in addition to expressing sincere repentance and making up that day, expiate for doing so by freeing a Muslim slave, hence the importance Islam attaches to liberating people from the shackles of servitude. If they cannot find any slaves to set free, as is the case today, they must fast for two consecutive months; if they are unable do so, then they have to feed sixty poor people.||<h3>Voluntary Fasting||<p>Muslims are required to observe a strict month-long fast once a year, that is, during the month of Ramadaan. They are also recommended, as long as they are able to do so, to fast on other days in order to gain more rewards. These days include the following:||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 250px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/dates2.jpg\" />||<ol>||<li>The day of ‛Aashuraa’, as well as a day before it or after it:‛Aashuraa’ is the tenth day of the lunar month of Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar. It is the very day Allah ﷻ saved Moses ﷺ and drowned Pharaoh and his army. A Muslim fasts it as an expression of gratitude to Allah for saving Moses and to follow in the footsteps of our Prophet ﷺ who not only fasted on this day but also asked his companions to fast a day before it or a day after it. <em>(MusnadAhmad: 2154).</em> When he was asked about fasting on it, he replied, “It expiates [the sins committed in] the previous year.”<em>(Saheeh Muslim: 1162)</em>&emsp;||<li>The Day of ‛Arafah:‛Arafah is the ninth day of the lunar month of Dhul-Hjjah, the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar. On this day, pilgrims who perform the hajj, the annual Muslim pilgrimage, gather in the wide open plain of ‛Arafah and engage in invoking Allah, praising Him and glorifying Him. ‛Arafah is the best day of the year, and those who are not performing the hajj may fast on it. When the Prophet ﷺ was asked about fasting on this day, he replied, “It atones for the sins committed the preceding year and the coming year.”<em> (Saheeh Muslim: 1162)</em>||<li>Six days of Shawwaal: Shawwaal is the tenth month of the Islamic calendar. The Prophet ﷺ said, “Whoever fasts in Ramadaan then follows it up with six days of the month of Shawwaal will obtain the rewards of fasting for the entire year.” <em>(Saheeh Muslim: 1164)</em>||",

When the Prophet ﷺ arrived in Madeenah, he found that the people there had set aside two days in the year for fun. He asked them, ‘‘What are these two days?” “We used to play and have fun on these days before the advent of Islam,” they replied. The Prophet ﷺ then said, “Allah has given you two better days: ‛Eed-ul-Fitr and (‛Eed-ul-Adhaa.” (Sunan Abu Daawood: 1134) Explaining that festivals represent the religion of their followers, he once observed, “Every nation has a festival, and this is our festival.” <em>(Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 909; Saheeh Muslim: 892)</em>||<h3>The Meaning of ‛Eed in Islam||<div>||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 300px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/alquds.jpg\" />||<p>‛Eed is a day of festivity and rejoicing.

They share happiness with everyone by putting on their best clothes, giving charity to the poor and the needy and engaging in permissible celebrations and festivities which make everyone happy and remind them of Allah’s favours upon them.||<p> ||<h3>Muslim Festivals||<p>There are only two annual festivals in Islam, and Muslims must not celebrate any other day apart from them. They are: (1) The Festival of Fast Breaking (‛Eed-ul-Fitr), which is celebrated on the first day of the lunar month of Shawwaal, and (2) the Festival of Sacrifice (‛Eed-ul-Adhaa), which is celebrated on the tenth day of the lunar month of Dhul-Hijjah.||<h3>The Festival of Fast Breaking (‛Eed-ul-Fitr)||<p>‛Eed-ul-Fitr falls on the first day of the lunar month of Shawwaal, marking the end of the month-long Ramadaan fast. Just as fasting during the month of Ramadaan is an act of worship, celebrating ‛Eed-ul-Fitris also an act of worship whereby Muslims express their gratitude to Allah for enabling them to perform this act of worship and for completing His grace upon them. As the Qur’an states, “You should complete the number of days and proclaim Allah’s greatness for the guidance He has given you so that you will be thankful.” <em>(Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2:185)</em>||<h3>What Should Be Done On the ‛Eed Day?||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 300px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/salat.jpg\" />||<ol>||<li><span class=\"style2\">Offering the ‛Eed Prayer: </span>Islam stresses that the ‛Eedprayer should be performed. In fact, it was one of those practices which the Prophet ﷺ observed consistently and even encouraged not only men but also women and children to observe. Its time starts after the sun has risen to the length of a spear above the horizon (just over 1 metre) and lasts until it has crossed the meridian.\\r Description: The ‛Eed prayer consists of two units (rak‛aat; singular rak‛ah) in which the imaam recites the Qur’an loudly, after which he delivers a sermon (khutbah) in two parts. This prayer contains several takbeeraat (singular takbeerah, one’s saying Allaahu akbar) at the beginning of each unit more than the ordinary prayer: The imaam says Allaahu akbar and, before he starts reciting the Qur’an, repeats the same utterance six more times; also, after rising from the prostrate position to the standing position to perform the second unit, he repeats the same utterance five more times in addition to the takbeer he has recited while rising to the second unit. The worshippers follow the imaam in these movements, doing and saying exactly the same. \\r .||<p> ||<ol>||<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"style2\">Paying Zakaat-ul-Fitr:</span> Allah has enjoined zakaat-ul-fitr (literally, the purifying obligatory charity of the breaking of the fast) on anyone who possesses a day’s and night’s worth of food. It consists of one saa‛ of the most common staple food of the country, be it rice, wheat or dates, and must be given to the Muslim poor and needy so that there would be no person in need of food on the ‛Eedday .It is permissible, however, to pay the value of zakaat-ul-fitr in money instead if it appears that this will be more beneficial to the poor. \\r <strong>Time of Its Payment:</strong> Zakaat-ul-fitr is to be paid from the time the sun sets on the last day of Ramadaan up to the time of the ‛Eed prayer. It may, however, be paid a day or two before the ‛Eed day as well.\\r <strong>The amount</strong> of zakaat-ul-fitris one saa‛ of the usual foods tuffs of the country, be it rice, wheat or dates. One saa‛ is equivalent to approximately 3 kg. \\r <strong>A Muslim</strong> must pay it for himself and all the persons he is legally bound to support, such as his wife and children. It is recommended to pay it on behalf of an unborn child. \\r The Prophet ﷺ enjoined it as,“atonement for any obscene language used while observing the fast and for providing food for the needy. It would be accepted as zakaat from those who pay it before the ‛Eed prayer, but it would be considered as mere sadaqah (voluntary charity) for those who pay it after the ‛Eed prayer.”<em class=\"style2 style1\"> (Sunan Abu Daawood: 1609)</em>\\r<span class=\"style2\"></span>||<li><span class=\"style2\">Muslims on this occasion :</span> spread joy and merriment to all family members, young and old, men and women, providing all possible types of lawful amusements. They wear their best and most beautiful clothes and eat and drink, as doing so is an act of worship. Fasting on this day is strictly forbidden.||<li><span class=\"style2\">They recite the : </span>takbeer on this special occasion on the night preceding the ‛Eed day and on the way to the ‛Eed prayer, and continue doing so until the imaam appears for the‛Eed prayers starts, expressing gratitude to Allah ﷻ for enabling them to complete the fast of Ramadaan. The Qur’an states, “He wants you to complete the prescribed period and to glorify Him for having guided you, so that you may be thankful.” <em>(Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2:185)</em>||<p><strong>The manner of takbeer pronounced on this occasion is as follows:</strong> <em>Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, laa ilaaha ill allaah, Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, walillaahil-hamd</em> (Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest; there is no god worthy of worship except Allah; Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest; all praise belongs to Allah).||<p>One may also recite the following: <em>Allaah uakbaru kabeeran, wal-hamdu lillaahi katheeran, wa subhaan-Allaahi bukratan waaseelaa</em> (Allah is the Greatest;His is the abundant praise, and glory be to Him day and night).||<p>Men generally pronounce the <em>takbeer</em> aloud, but without disturbing other people; women, however, pronounce it quietly..||<p> ",

Indeed, He links brotherhood of faith with sincere repentance, offering the prayers and paying the zakaat, as the Qur’an states, “Yet if they repent and establish regular prayers and pay the zakaat, then they are your brothers in faith.” (Soorat At-Tawbah, 9:11) The Prophet ﷺ also said, “Islam has been built on five [pillars]: Testifying that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, performing the prayers, paying the zakat, making the pilgrimage to the House, and fasting in Ramadaan.”(Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree:8; Saheeh Muslim: 16)",

        "body1": "<h2>Zakaat||<h3>The Ultimate Objectives of Zakaat :||<p class=\"style1\">Allah ﷻ has enjoined zakaat on the Muslims for a number of reasons including the following:||<ol>||<li>Love of wealth is an innate human tendency, and man does whatever he possibly can to acquire it. It is for this reason that Islam requires him to pay zakaat to purify his heart from selfishness and greed, as the Qur’an states, “Take zakaat from their wealth to purify and cleanse them.”<em> (Soorat At-Tawbah, 9:103)</em>||<li>Paying zakaat nurtures feelings of affection and harmony and fosters community cohesion. Because people generally have a disposition to like those who do them a good turn, members of the Muslim society become so close-knit that they resemble bricks of a building, supporting one another. Crimes such as theft and robbery tend to drop off.||<li>Paying zakaat is a vivid expression of true worship and total submission to Allah ﷻ. When the wealthy pay zakaat they actually obey Allah’s commands, recognising that all prosperity ultimately comes from Allah’s favour and grace. By doing so, they also show thankfulness to Him for having bestowed His blessings upon them: “If you are grateful, I will certainly give you increase.”<em> (Soorat Ibraaheem, 14:7)</em>||<li>By paying zakaat the concept of social security and relative equality among members of society is realised. When the wealthy distribute the annual amount of zakaat among the rightful beneficiaries, wealth ceases to build up in a few hands and is instead kept in constant circulation. As the Qur’an states, “This is so that they do not just circulate among those of you who are rich.”<em> (Soorat Al-Hashr, 59:7)</em>||<div>||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 250px;\">||<caption>Love of wealth is an innate human tendency, and Islam requires its followers not to be obsessively attached to wealth and to pay zakaat in order topurify their heartsfrom selfish greed.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/money3.jpg\" />||",

After instructing pilgrims about what to do regarding the sacrificial animal they have to slaughter to seek closeness to Allah, Allah ﷻ states, “Their flesh and blood do does not reach Allah: it is your piety that reaches Him.” <em>(Soorat Al-Hajj, 22:37)</em> The prophet ﷺ also said in this connection, “Going round the Ka‛bah, running between the hills of As-Safaa and Al-Marwah and the stoning of the pillars are only meant for the remembrance of Allah.”<em> (Sunan Abu Daawood: 1888)</em>||<p class=\"style1\">These goals and objectives include the following:||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"1\">A demonstration of total submission and humility to Allah||<p>This is realised when pilgrims forsake all forms of luxury and adornment and wear simple seamless garments before assuming the condition of ritual purity (ihraam), showing their total need and dependence on their Lord and ridding themselves of all worldly concerns and pursuits that may otherwise distract them from demonstrating total devotion to Him, which is bound to invite His mercy and forgiveness. This demonstration of total submission becomes all the more vivid on the Day of ‛Arafah when they stand before their Lord, in a state of awe and reverence, giving thanks to Him for His countless blessings and seeking His forgiveness for their slips and failings.||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"2\">A demonstration of gratefulness to Allah||<p>Gratefulness to Allah for performing hajj is shown for both the money and good health Allah ﷻ has provided, which are amongst the greatest worldly blessings Allah has bestowed on man. When a Muslim performs hajj, he actually demonstrates gratefulness to Allah for these two blessings by undergoing great physical hardships and spending his money to seek closeness to Allah, in total obedience to Him. Showing gratefulness is a duty that is not only established and affirmed by reasoning but also ordained by divine law.||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"3\">A wholesome demonstration of the universality of Islam||<p>Muslims from the four corners of the world gather in the holy land in response to the call of Allah. They get to know one another, and the barriers of гасе, colour, language and social class аге set aside in this fraternity of faith that unites all Muslims in the largest, annual human gathering in which they help one another in furthering virtue and God-consciousness.||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"4\">It is a reminder of the Day of Judgement||<p>Hajj reminds those who perform it, of the Day of Resurrection when all human beings will stand equal before Allah for the final judgement. When pilgrims stand in the plain of ‛Arafah, after assuming the state of ritual purity (ihraam) by replacing their ordinary clothes with simple garments and expressing their readiness to serve Allah, and perceive the countless multitudes of pilgrims, all dressed in what looks like shrouds, this will open their eyes to what they will go through after death and will prompt them to strive harder in preparation for the hereafter.||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"5\">It is a demonstration of true worship of Allah alone||<p>This is realised through the pilgrims’ recitation of the talbiyah: Labbayk-Allaahumma labbayk, labbayka laa shareeka laka labbayk, innal-hamda wanni‛mata laka wal-mulk, laa shareeka lak (Here I am at Your service O Allah, here I am. Here I am at Your service. You have no partners. Yours alone is all praise and all bounty, and Yours alone is the sovereignty. You have no partners.” Describing talbiyah the one of the Prophet’s companions once referred to them as words of “pure monotheism”. <em>(Saheeh Muslim: 1218)</em> Indeed, pure monotheism is apparent in all the hajj rites, words and deeds without exception.||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 220px; height: 280px;\">||<caption>Muslims are required to perform ‛umrah once in their lifetime if they are able to do so.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/kaaba.jpg\" />||<div id=\"dotted-box\" style=\"float: left; width: 300px;\">||<h2>‛Umrah||<p>Umrah, or minor pilgrimage (hajj being the major pilgrimage), is an act of worship which consists of ritual practices that are confined to the Sacred Mosque area only, namely entering the sacred state of purity (ihraam), walking seven times round the Ka‛bah, walking seven times between the hills of As-Safaa and Al-Marwah, and then having one’s head shaved off or one’s hair cut short\\r The Islamic ruling regarding ‛umrah: It is obligatory for those who can afford it once in their lifetime and it is recommended to perform it again and again.\\r Its time: It may be undertaken anytime throughout the year, but performing it during the month of Ramadaan has a special merit, as the Prophet ﷺ states, “Performing ‛umrah during the month of Ramadaan is equal to performing hajj (pilgrimage) in merit and excellence.”<em> (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 3186; Saheeh Muslim: 520)</em>||",

A sheep must be at least six months, a goat one year old, a cow two years old, and a camel five years old.||<li>It should be free from apparent defects, because the Prophet ﷺ said, “There are four [types of animals] that will not do for sacrifice: a one-eyed or blind animal whose defect is obvious, a sick animal whose sickness is obvious, a lame animal whose lameness is obvious and an emaciated animal that has no marrow in its bones.” (Sunan An-Nasaa’ee: 4371; Sunan At-Tirmidhee, 1497).||<h3>What Should Be Done with the Sacrificial Animal?||<ul>||<li>It is forbidden to sell any part of the sacrificial animal.||<li>It is recommended to divide it into three parts: one part for eating, one third to be given as gifts and one third to be given in charity to the poor and the needy.||<li>It is permissible to authorise someone to slaughter a sacrificial animal on one’s behalf, such as trustworthy charitable societies that undertake the slaughter of sacrificial animals and distribute them to the needy.||",

It covers any stipulated additional amount over the principal in a transaction of loan or debt and is of two types.||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 200px;\">||<caption>Every loan or debt from which the lender makes a profit is a form of ribaa.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/dollers_1.jpg\" />||<ul>||<li class=\"style2\">Ribaa on Debts||<p>This type of ribaa exists in every debt, which carries a stipulation binding the debtor to pay to the creditor any sum of money in excess of the principal sum of the debt.||<p>Example: John borrows £1000 from Martin and promises to pay it back after a month. However, John finds himself unable to pay the debt off after a month and so Martin, the creditor, stipulates that John either pays the debt off without any excess of the principal sum of the debt or pay £1100 after another month. If, however, he still cannot possibly pay that sum off either after a month, Martin will defer payment another month on condition that John pays £1200.||<ul>||<li class=\"style2\">Ribaa on Loans||<p>In this type of ribaa, a person takes out a loan from another person or from a bank with the stipulation at the time of the contract that the borrower must pay an annual interest both parties agree upon of, say 5%, on the borrowed amount to the lender.||<p>Example: John is interested in a house which is worth £100,000 but does not have enough money to purchase it, so he takes out a loan from the bank on condition that he must pay the bank £150,000 in monthly instalments over a period of five years.\\r Ribaa is strictly forbidden in Islam and is one of the major sins as long as the loan is taken out with interest, whether it is an investment loan for financing a business or industry or purchasing a vital asset such as a house or property, or a consumer loan for personal, family or household purposes.\\r However, purchasing goods in instalments at a price higher than the actual price paid in cash is not considered a form of ribaa.\\r Example: A person has the choice to purchase a kitchen appliance for £1000 and pay for it in cash or for £1200 in monthly instalments, paying a monthly amount of £100 to the owner of the store from which he purchased the appliance.",
        "title2": "The Islamic Ruling on Ribaa",
        "body2": "<h3>The Islamic Ruling on Ribaa||<p>Textual evidence from the Qur’an and the Prophet’s traditions, points out that ribaa is strictly forbidden in Islam, that it is one of the major sins and that Allah has not declared war on any one of the sinners except those who deal with ribaa. In fact, ribaa is forbidden, not only in Islam but also in all previous divine religions. Such a ruling, however, was changed after numerous distortions crept into the religious texts of such religions, and altered many other rulings. Allah ﷻ mentions that he inflicted punishment on a group of the People of the Book “for their taking usury although it had been forbidden to them.” (Soorat An-Nisaa’, 4:161)||<h3>Punishment for Ribaa||<ol>||<li>Those who engage in usurious transactions expose themselves to a war which Allah ﷻ and His Messenger ﷺ have declared on those who deal with ribaa, thereby becoming their enemies. As the Qur’an states, “If you do not do so, be warned of war from Allah and His Messenger. But if you repent, you may have your capital, without wronging and without being wronged.” (Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2: 279) Indeed, such a war leaves devastating physical and psychological effects, and the numerous forms of deep anxiety and depression that have afflicted people these days are some signs of such a war which Allah has declared on those who disobey His commands by engaging in usurious transactions. The effects of such war in the hereafter will be far worse than one can possibly imagine.||<li>Those who engage in usurious transactions in any way are deprived of Allah’s mercy. Jaabir ibn‛Abdullaah  narrated: “Allah’s Messenger cursed the person who accepts usury (interest), the one who gives it, the one who records it and the two witnesses to it.” He said, “They are all sinners.” (Saheeh Muslim: 1598)||<li>They will be resurrected on the Day of Judgement in such an unsightly manner that they will be staggering, jerking and shaking like someone suffering from madness or experiencing epileptic seizures, as the Qur’an states, “Those who take unlawful interest will stand before Allah [on the Day of Judgement] as those who suffer from a mental imbalance because of Satan’s touch.” (Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2: 275)||<li>Profits made from usurious transactions, no matter how massive they may look, will be deprived of all blessing, and those who make use of such profits will find neither happiness, nor peace of mind, as the Qur’an states, “Allah deprives usurious gains of all blessing, whereas He blesses charitable deeds with manifold increase.” (Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2: 276)||",

        "body3": "<h3>Detrimental Effects of Ribaaon the Individual and Society||<p>Islam has strictly forbidden ribaa due to the great deal of harm it is bound to inflict on both the individual and society. Such detrimental effects include the following:||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"1\">It causes a severe disorder in the distribution of wealth and widens the gulf between the rich and the poor||<p>Because ribaa tends to concentrate wealth in the hands of a few individuals and prevents it from being used for the general good of the community, it causes an inequitable distribution of wealth and resources and divides society into a tiny super-rich minority and a large poor or deprived large majority, a state of affairs which normally gives rise to hatred and crimes in society.||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"2\">It encourages wasteful extravagance||<p>The fact that taking out loans from financial institutions that charge interest on such loans has become more readily available than ever before has encouraged many people to become big wasters. Finding a financial institution from which to borrow money to meet all kinds of needs, they tend to spend lavishly on luxury items, only to find themselves burdened by debts which cause them depression, anxiety and stress and which they cannot possibly pay off.||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"3\">It dissuades investors from investing in domestic beneficial projects||<p>Lured by the interest gains the usurious system allows investors to derive from their capital, they desist from investing their capital in domestic industrial, agricultural and commercial projects, no matter how beneficial such projects may be to society, as they believe these projects involve some risk and require a great deal of effort.||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"4\">It deprives wealth of all blessing and leads to economic crises||<p>All economic crises undergone by financial institutions and individuals alike are, in the main, caused by persistence in engaging in usurious transactions and are some of the reasons why such transactions are deprived of all blessing, as opposed to charitable deeds which are bound to bless wealth and increase it.

The prophet ﷺ said in this connection, “Beware of injustice, for indeed injustice will be darkness on the Day of Judegment.”(Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 2315; Saheeh Muslim: 2579)||<p>Indeed, Islam considers the act of taking other people’s property wrongfully, no matter how small it this property may be, one of the most odious sins and warns those who commit it against severe punishment in the hereafter. As the prophet ﷺ said, “If anyone takes a span of land unjustly, its extent taken from seven earths will be tied round his neck on the Day of Resurrection.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 2321; Saheeh Muslim: 1610)||<p> ||<p class=\"style2\">Examples of forms of injustice committed in business transactions||<ol>||<li>Coercion: A transaction that is conducted under coercion in any form whatsoever invalidates the contract. Indeed, mutual consent between the parties to the contract is a necessary condition for the validity of a business transaction, as the prophet ﷺ once observed, “A sale is a sale only if it is made through mutual consent. (Sunan Ibn Maajah: 2185)||<li>Dishonesty: deceiving other people to take their property wrongfully is one of the major sins, as the prophet ﷺ said, “Whoever cheats us is not one of us.” (Saheeh Muslim: 101). Once, while the prophet ﷺ was walking in the market, he passed by a pile of food and put his hands inside it. Feeling water on his fingers, he turned to the seller of the food and said, “What is this?” “It was left out in the rain, Messenger of Allah,” he replied. “Why don’t you put the wet food on top of the pile so that people can see it?” the prophet ﷺ disapprovingly said, “Whoever deceives us is not one of us.” (Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 1315)||<li>||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 172px;\"> ||<caption> Allah’s Messenger r has cursed those who give bribes and those who take them.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/rashwa_0.jpg\" />||<li>Manipulating the Law: Some cunning people, when presenting their cases in court, speak in honeyed tones and in a convincing manner in order to take other people’s property wrongfully, not realising that even if the judge rules in their favour he cannot possibly turn falsehood into truth. Addressing some of his companions once, the prophet ﷺ said, “I am only a human being, and litigants come to me to settle their disputes. It may be that one of you may present his case more eloquently and in a more convincing way than his opponent, whereby I may consider him to be in the right and thus pass a judgement in his favour based on what I have heard. Therefore, if I ever give the right of a Muslim to another by mistake [while he knows that he is in the wrong], then the one in the wrong must not take, for I will actually be giving him only a piece of Fire.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 6748; Saheeh Muslim: 1713)||<li>Bribery: Bribery is a sum of money given or a service rendered in order to influence the judgement or conduct of a person in a position of trust and thus get something illegally. Islam considers bribery one of the most atrocious forms of injustice and the most heinous sins. The prophet ﷺ went as far as to curse those who give bribes and those who accept them.” (Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 1337)||<p>When bribery becomes widespread, it destroys the very fabric of society and affects its development and prosperity.||<h4>What is the Islamic ruling regarding a person who has taken people’s property before embracing Islam?||<p>If a person embraces Islam while he is still in possession of money which he has acquired as a result deceiving or assaulting others through theft or embezzlement, for instance, then he must return it to its legal owners as long as he knows them and can do so without incurring any harm whatsoever upon himself.||<p>Even if he has committed such an injustice before embracing Islam, the money he has taken from other people wrongfully is still in his possession and he must thus return it to is legitimate owners, as the Qur’an states, “Allah commands you to deliver trusts back to their owners.” (Soorat An-Nisaa’, 4:58)||<p>If, however, he does not know its rightful owners after exhausting all possible ways to find out who they are, he can get rid of it by giving it away to charity.",

In this way, a person risks money upon an agreement that he or someone else will receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome. Put simply, gambling involves betting that must result either in a gain or a loss, and the gambler profits solely at another person’s loss.||<h3>The Islamic Ruling on Gambling||<p class=\"style1\">Gambling is strictly forbidden, as supported by textual evidence from the Qur’an and the Prophet’s traditions, including the following:||<ol>||<li>Allah ﷻ considers the sin of engaging in gambling to be far greater than the profit gained from it, as the Qur’an states, “They will ask you about alcoholic drinks and gambling. Say, ‘There is great wrong in both of them and also certain benefits for mankind. But the wrong in them is greater than the benefit.’”(Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2: 219)||<li>Allah ﷻ considers it to be a type of filth and abomination due to its detrimental effects on the individual and society and commands the faithful to avoid it as it sows enmity and hatred amongst them and turns them away from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer, as the Qur’an states, “O you who believe, intoxicants, gambling, stone altars and divining arrows are abominations devised by Satan. Avoid them so that you may be successful. Satan only seeks to sow enmity and hatred among you by means of wine and gambling, and to keep you from the remembrance of God and from your prayers. Will you not then abstain?” (Soorat Al-Maa’idah,5:90-1)||<h3>Detrimental Effects of Gambling on the Individual and Society||<p>Gambling has numerous adverse effects on the individual and society including the following:||<ol>||<li>It precipitates enmity and hatred among gamblers, for when friends gamble and one of them wins and takes their money they will undoubtedly feel hatred towards him and hold grudges against him and even plot against him and harm him. This is a known fact that is based upon observation. The Qur’an states in this context, “Satan only seeks to sow enmity and hatred among you by means of wine and gambling.” Besides, it distracts from the obligatory prayers and the remembrance of Allah, as the Qur’an states in the context of mentioning Satan’s tireless effort to make gambling look good to man, “and to keep you from the remembrance of Allah and from your prayers. Will you not then abstain?” (Soorat Al-Maa’idah,5:90-1)||<li>It destroys wealth and causes gamblers to suffer heavy financial losses and personal or legal problems.||<li>The thrill of gambling and the possibility of winning becomes addictive. If the gambler wins, he becomes greedier and gets carried away, hopeful to acquire more ill-gotten gains. If he loses, he does not give up easily and carries on gambling in the hope of getting back what he has lost. Both gain and loss stand in the way of productive work and constitute a creeping evil that destroys society.||",

For instance, a group of people have a game of cards, each one of them setting aside a certain amount of money, and the winner takes all of it.||<li>Betting, which is the act of risking money on the unknown result of an event. For instance, each gambler places a bet on a certain team in, say, a football match, and one can only win the bet if the team on which the bet is placed wins, otherwise the bet is lost, which meansloss of money.||<li>Lottery, which is a type of gambling that has the element of chance. In a lottery, lots, usually in the form of tickets, are purchased and a lot is randomly selected to win a prize, usually a large sum of money. For instance, one purchases a ticket for £1 in the hope of winning £1000.||<li>All types of gambling without exception, casino or non-casino gambling games, such as electronic and online gambling, involve money that gamblers can either win or lose.||",

        "body1": "<h2>Examples of Business Ethics which Islam Has Stressed||<p>Islam instructs its followers to observe certain ethics when they engage in financial transactions, including the following:||<div>||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 100px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/secretariat.jpg\" />||<h4>Honesty||<p class=\"style1\">Islam requires its adherents to be honest in their dealings with Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Indeed, honesty is one of the most important moral principles which testifies to a Muslim’s devoutness. Its importance is indicated in a number of Qur’anic verses and traditions of the prophet ﷺ , including the following:||<ul>||<li>Allah says, “Allah commands you to deliver trusts back to their owners.” (Soorat An-Nisaa’, 4:58)||<li>The prophet ﷺ considers betraying the trust as one of the signs of hypocrisy: “The signs of the hypocrite are three: when he speaks he lies, when he promises he breaks his promise and when he is entrusted he betrays the trust.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 33; Saheeh Muslim: 59)||<li>Honesty is among the characteristics of the believers whom Allah calls ‘‘successful’’ because they “honour their trusts and their contracts”, among other traits. (Soorat Al-Mu’minoon, 23:8)||<li>It is for this reason that the prophet ﷺ considers those who do not fulfil the terms and conditions of the trusts which are placed in their charge to have no faith: “The person who does not fulfil the terms of his trust has no faith.” (Sunan Ahmad: 12567)||<li>The prophet ﷺ was known by his honorific title of As-Saadiq al-Ameen (the truthful and trustworthy) before the advent of Islam, for he was the epitome of honesty in all his dealings.||<div>||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 100px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/truth.jpg\" />||<h4>Truthfulness||<p class=\"style1\">Truthfulness and transparency are among the virtues that Islam has stressed||<ul>||<li>The prophet ﷺ said, “The seller and the buyer have the right to keep or return goods as long as they have not parted; and if both parties speak the truth and describe the defects and qualities of the goods, their transaction will be blessed; however, if they tell lies or hide something, their transaction will be deprived of all blessings.”(Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 1973; Saheeh Muslim: 1532)||<li>He also said, “Be truthful, for truthfulness leads to righteousness, and righteousness leads to Paradise. A man keeps on telling the truth until he becomes known as a truthful person.”(Saheeh Muslim: 2607)||<li>Some traders often have recourse to swearing falsely claiming that their merchandise is of good quality in order to persuade the buyers to purchase it. Islam considers such an act one of the major sins, as the prophet ﷺ said, “Allah will not speak to three types of people on the Day of Judgement, nor will He look at them, nor purify them and they will have a severe punishment.” Amongst these types he mentioned those who “swear falsely in order to sell their goods.”(Saheeh Muslim: 106)||<div>||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 100px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/pro.jpg\" />||<h4>Proficiency||<p class=\"style1\">A Muslim, no matter what his occupation may be, must carry out his duties with efficiency and to the best of his ability, making efficiency his guiding principle in all his endeavours||<ul>||<li>Allah ﷻ has prescribed proficiency in all things and requires Muslims to observe it in all aspects of life, even when doing things that may, on the surface, seem unimportant, such as hunting and slaughtering. The prophet ﷺ said in this regard, “Allah has prescribed proficiency in all things. Thus, if you kill, kill well; and if you slaughter, slaughter well. Let each one of you sharpen his blade and let him spare suffering to the animal he slaughters.” (Saheeh Muslim: 1955)||<li>Once, he attended the funeral of a man and gave instructions to his companions to level the grave and carry out the burial process efficiently. Then he turned to them and said, “Doing so will neither benefit the deceased, nor harm him; however, if a worker does any work, Allah loves to see him do it well and with efficiency.” (Al-Bayhaqee’sShu‛ab Al-Eemaan: 5315) Another narration reads, “If any of you undertakes to do any work, Allah loves to see him do it well and with efficiency.” (Musnad Abu Ya‛laa: 4386; Al-Bayhaqee’sShu‛ab Al-Eemaan: 4312) Read more about moral character on page 225||",

        "body2": "<h2>Intoxicants and Alcoholic Beverages||<p>An intoxicant is an agent that clouds the mind and produces in a person a state ranging from elation to stupor, usually accompanied by loss of inhibitions and control. As the Prophet ﷺ said, “Every intoxicant is khamr (wine), and every khamr is forbidden.”<em> (Saheeh Muslim: 2003)</em>. Therefore, any alcoholic drink is unlawful, whether it is made from fruit, such as grapes, dates, figs and raisins, or from grains, such as wheat, barley, corn and rice, or from sweet substances such as honey. Thus, the definition of khamr extends to any substance that intoxicates, in whatever form and under whatever name it may appear, even if it is added to natural fruit juice, sweets and chocolate.||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 230px; height: 300px;\">||<caption>Islam protects the mind against anything that is bound to harm it in any way.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/drunk.jpg\" />||<h3>Preservation of the Mind||<p>Islam seeks to realise people’s benefits in this life and in the hereafter, and amongst these ultimate benefits are the five necessities, namely, religion, life, the mind, property and progeny.||<p>The mind is the basis of legal responsibility (manaat at-takleef) and the main reason behind divine honour and favour on the human race. It is for this reason that Islam seeks to preserve it and protect it against anything that is bound to weaken it or derange it.||<h3>The Islamic Ruling on Alcoholic Drinks||<p>Consuming alcoholic drinks, such as wine, is one of the major sins and its prohibition is confirmed by textual evidence from the Qur’an and the Prophet’s traditions, including the following:||<ul>||<li>The Qur’an says, “O you who believe, intoxicants, gambling, stone altars and divining arrows are abominations devised by Satan. Avoid them so that you may be successful.” <em>(Soorat Al-Maa’idah, 5:90)</em> Allah ﷻ describes all types of intoxicants as a type of filth and abomination and commands the believers to avoid them in order to secure success in this life and in the hereafter.||<li>The Prophet ﷺ said, “Every intoxicant is wine (khamr), and every wine is unlawful. Whoever drinks wine in this world and dies addicted to it without repentance will not drink it in the hereafter.” <em>(Saheeh Muslim: 2003)</em>||<li>Explaining once that drinking wine decreases faith and contradicts it altogether, he once declared, “When somebody takes an alcoholic drink, then he is not a believer at the time of drinking it.” <em>(Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 5256; Saheeh Muslim: 57).</em>||<li>Allah has imposed corporal punishment on drinkers, and so they lose their dignity and credibility in society.||<li>He ﷻ warns those who persist in drinking wine, and all intoxicants for that matter, and die without ever repenting with a severe punishment in the hereafter. As the Prophet ﷺ said, “Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, made a covenant to those who drink intoxicants to make them drink Teenat al-Khabaal.” <em>(Saheeh Muslim: 2002).</em> Teenat al-Khabaal refers to the pus and other unpleasant fluids that ooze out of the bodies of those doomed to Hellfire.||<li>In fact, this severe warning also extends to those who get involved in any way in any action related to the production and drinking of alcohol, for the Prophet ﷺ “cursed ten types of people in connection with alcoholic drinks: those who produce them, those for whom they are produced, those who drink them, those who serve them, those who carry them, those for whom they are carried, those who serve them, those who sell them, those who benefit from the price paid for them, those who buy them, and those for whom they are bought.” <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 1295).</em>||",

The Prophet ﷺ once advised, “Do not drink out of gold and silver vessels, nor eat from gold or silver plates, for they are for the unbelievers in this world and for us in the hereafter.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaare: 5110; Saheeh Muslim: 2067)||<li>Washing one’s hands before and after eating. Doing so becomes all the more emphasised if the hands are dirty or there are some food residues on them.||<li>Pronouncing the name of Allah (that is, saying Bismillaah) before eating or drinking. If, however, a person forgets to mention Allah’s name at the beginning of the meal and remembers that he has not said so only after he has already started eating, he must say upon remembering, Bismillaahi awwalihi wa aakhirihi (I begin with the Name of Allah at the beginning and at the end)”.\\r Perceiving once that a young boy was not observing the Islamic etiquettes of eating, the Prophet ﷺ advised him, “Young man, mention the name of Allah, eat with your right hand and eat from what is directly in front of you.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 5061; Saheeh Muslim: 2022)||<li>Eating and drinking with the right hand: The Prophet ﷺ said, “Do not eat with your left hand, for Satan eats with his left hand.” (Saheeh Muslim: 2019)||<li>It is recommended not to eat or drink while standing.||<li>Eating from the side of the dish nearer to oneself, for it is not polite to eat from other sides of the dish that are nearer to other people. Advising the young boy, the Prophet ﷺ said to him, “Eat from what is directly in front of you.”||<li>It is recommended to pick up a morsel that has fallen down, clean it, wipe off any dirt on it and eat it, so as not to be wasteful.||<li>Not to criticise food for any reason. One must either praise it or leave it without saying anything. The Prophet ﷺ never criticised any food presented to him; he would eat it if he liked it; otherwise, he would leave it without expressing his dislike. (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 5093; Saheeh Muslim: 2064)||<li>Avoiding excessive eating, for doing so generally causes diseases and laziness, while moderation is the best course of action in this respect. As the Prophet ﷺ once observed, “No man fills a vessel worse than his stomach. A few mouthfuls would suffice to give him the strength he needs. But if he must eat more, then he should fill one third [of his stomach] with food, one third with drink and leave one third for easy breathing.” (Sunan At-Tirmdhee: 2380; Sunan Ibn Maajah: 3349)||<li>Expressing thanks to Allah by saying Al-hamdu lillaah (All praise is due to Allah). One may, however, add the following words: Al-hamdu lillaah-illadhee at‛amanee haadhaa wa razaqaneehi min ghayri hawlin minnee walaa quwwah (Praise be to Allah who has fed me this food and provided it for me, without any strength or power on my part).||<div>||<div class=\"mosaic-block-white bar\" style=\"width: 430px; height: 333px;\">||<caption>The prophet ﷺ said, “Allah is pleased with a slave of His who eats something and praises Him for it and drinks something and praises Him for it.” (Saheeh Muslim: 2734)||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/breakfast.jpg\" />||",

It considers all types of clothing lawful as long as such clothing serves the required purposes without exceeding the bounds set by Islam in this respect.\\r The Prophet ﷺ wore the same type of clothes prevalent in his time and did not order people to wear a particular type of clothing. He only warned them against certain qualities relating to clothing, for the general rule in Islamic Law regarding dealings in general, including clothing, is that everything is allowed unless there is evidence which states otherwise; this means nothing is considered forbidden except with evidence, as opposed to acts of worship, such as the prayer and fasting, which are governed by the principle of restriction, in that legally responsible people must not perform any act of worship unless it becomes clear to them that it is prescribed and approved by Allah Himself, and thus no act of worship may be performed without textual evidence from the Qur’an and the Prophet’s Sunnah.\\r The Prophet ﷺ said, “Eat, drink, dress and give charity, but without extravagance or arrogance.” <em>(Sunan An-Nasaa’ee: 2559)</em>||<div>||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 250px;\">||<caption>While Islam outlines a code of modesty, it has no fixed standard as to a type of clothing that Muslims must wear.

We have sent down clothing to you to conceal your private parts.”<em> (Soorat Al-A‛raaf, 7:26)</em>\\r Islam has fixed the standards of modesty for both men and women. For men, the minimum amount to be covered is between the navel and the knee. For women who are in the presence of men not related to them, they must cover their bodies except for their face and hands. \\r Islam requires that clothing must also be loose enough to cover the body properly. Therefore, skin-tight and see-through clothes are not allowed in Islam. In fact, the Prophet ﷺ warned those people who do not observe modesty in dress, calling them “types among the people of Hellfire”, one of them being “women who are clothed yet naked”.||<li>Clothing that involves dressing like or imitating the opposite sex: This type of clothing is strictly forbidden in Islam and wearing it is considered one of the major sins. This imitation may be extended to include imitation in the manner of speaking, gait and movement, for Allah’s Messenger ﷺ cursed men who wear women’s clothes and women who wear men’s clothes.<em> (Sunan Abu Daawood: 4098)</em> He also cursed men who make themselves look like women and women who make themselves look like men.<em> (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 5546)</em> By directing men and women to observe different modes of dress, Islam takes into account the biological differences between them and encourages them to act in accordance with the dictates of reason and dictates of sound reason and the pure inner nature innate in all humans (fitrah).||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 230px; height: 200px;\">||<caption>It is prohibited to wear clothing which involves imitation of the dress traditionally worn by non-Muslims or clothing of religious significance.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/cross-tshirt.jpg\" />||<ol><ol>||<li>Clothing that involves imitation of the dress traditionally worn by non-Muslims, such as the type of clothing worn by monks and priests and wearing a cross. This also includes clothing that is specific to a certain religion, for the Prophet ﷺ said, “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” <em>(Sunan Abu Daawood: 4031)</em> This imitation extends to wearing clothing of religious significance. Imitation of this type is a sign of weakness and lack of confidence in the truth one adopts.\\r Imitation here does not include wearing clothing that is predominant in one’s country even if such dress is worn by the majority of non-Muslims, for the Prophet ﷺ used to wear clothing that was common amongst the Quraysh pagans with the exception of those clothing items that are expressly forbidden.||<li>Clothing that is worn with pride and conceit: The Prophet ﷺ said, “No one who has an atom’s weight of pride in his heart will enter Paradise.”<em> (Saheeh Muslim: 91)</em>\\r It is for this reason that Islam warns against trailing one’s lower garments on the ground out of pride. The Prophet ﷺ said, “On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will not even look at those who drag their garments on the ground out of pride.” <em>(Saheeh Al-Bukhaare: 3465; Saheeh Muslim: 2085)</em>\\r Islam also warns against wearing the so-called libaas ash-shuhrah (flamboyant, flashy clothing). In fact, this term refers to a number of things including any type of weird clothing which has certain qualities that attract the attention of the general public, making its wearer known for it; ‘notorious clothing’ due to its type or loud and repulsive colour; any type of clothing that makes its wearer an object of pride and fame, attracting too much attention to himself. The Prophet ﷺ said, “Whoever wears clothes of shuhrah in this world, Allah will make him wear clothes of humiliation on the Day of Judgement.” <em>(Musnad Ahmad: 5664; Sunan Ibn Maajah: 3607)</em>||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 230px; height: 240px;\">||<caption>Extravagant clothing is forbidden, but this varies from one person to another depending on one’s income and financial obligations one has to fulfil.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/expensive.jpg\" />||<ol>||<li>Silk clothing or clothing adorned with gold or silk for men: Referring to gold and silk once, the Prophet ﷺ said, “These are forbidden for men among my followers but permissible for women.” (Sunan Ibn Maajah: 3595; Sunan Abu Daawood: 4057)\\r By silk is meant pure silk obtained from the cocoon of the silkworm.||<li>Extravagant clothing: The Prophet ﷺ once said, “Eat, give charity and wear clothes. Let no extravagance or pride be mixed with what you do.” <em>(Sunan An-Nasaa’ee: 2559)</em>\\r The manner of dressing, however, varies from one person to another depending on one’s social position. If a person is rich, he may purchase clothing that a poor person cannot afford, given his monthly outcome, economic position and other financial obligations he has to fulfil. While a piece of clothing may be considered a form of extravagance for a poor person, it may not be considered as such for a rich person.||",

The prophet ﷺ said in this regard, “Sometimes I fast and sometimes I don’t; I engage in night prayer and I also sleep, and I marry women.

Examples of forms of respect Islam shows to women include the following:\\r||<ul>||<li>Islam grants them the right to inheritance, allocating them equitable shares with men, which sometimes differ under certain circumstances depending on their relationship with others and the financial obligations they have to discharge. While men support the family as a matter of religious obligation, women are not obliged to spend a penny||<li>It establishes total equity between men and women in numerous matters including financial transactions. As the prophet ﷺ said, “Women are the twin halves of men.” (Sunan Abu Daawood: 236)\\r||<li>It grants them the right to choose ther husbands and places a large amount of the responsibility of bringing up children upon them, as the Prophet ﷺ said, “A woman is a guardian of her husband’s home and is responsible for it.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 853; Saheeh Muslim: 1829)\\r||<li>It grants them the right to keep their maiden names. In Islam, a woman does not change her surname to that of her husband upon marriage, as is common in many parts of the world; rather, she retains her maiden name, and thus her independent personality.\\r||<li>It makes it the husband’s duty to spend on those women entitled to his support, such as his wife, mother and daughters, without attempting in the least to remind them of his favours. \\r||<li>It stresses the importance of helping weak women who are in need of support, even if they are not one’s relatives, and urges its followers to engage in such a noble act, regarding it one of the meritorious deeds in the sight of Allah. The Prophet ﷺ said, “The person who looks after a widow or a poor person is like a warrior who fights for Allah’s cause, or like one who performs prayers all night without slackness and fasts continuously and never breaks his fast.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 5661; Saheeh Muslim: 2982).\\r||",

As the Qur’an states, “Do not covet what Allah has given to some of you in preference to others — men have a portion of what they acquire and women have a portion of what they acquire; but ask Allah for His bounty. (Soorat An-Nisaa’, 4:32) Indeed, Islam has honoured both men and women, and allocated each of them distinctive characteristics and roles whereby they may strive to gain Allah’s rewards and attain His pleasure. It does not give preference to any of the two sexes; rather, it aims to promote the welfare of the individual in general and that of society at large..||<p>Therefore, there is no such thing in Islam as as truggle between the sexes; there is no need for a fierce rivalry for worldly pursuits between them; nor is there a necessity to launch an attack against either of them in an attempt to disparage, harm, criticise or find fault with any one of them.\\r All this is vain in Islam and constitutes a misunderstanding of Islam’s view of the roles it has assigned to each one of them. In Islam, each one of them has a share according to what they have earned in both material and spiritual terms. Instead of envying each other, they are required to ask Allah to give them more of His bounty through lawful labour and through prayer.||<p> ",

By doing this, Islam aims to protect people’s honour and block all the means that are bound to lead to evil.

That will make for greater purity for them. Allah is aware of what they do. Say to believing women that they should lower their gaze and remain chaste.” (Soorat An-Noor, 24:30-31)\\r However, if a Muslim accidentally sees a woman, he must divert his eyes from her. In fact, the order to lower the gaze applies to anything that is bound to lead to sexual arousal, including those scenes that are presented in the media and on the Internet.||<p>||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"2\">Observing Modesty in Speech||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 230px; height: 240px;\">||<caption>Islam has laid down rules which govern the relationship between men and women.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/women.jpg\" />||<p>When talking to a woman who is not related to him,he must observe politeness and modesty and avoid any words or gestures which may lead to sexual stimulation.

Speak correct and courteous words.” (Soorat Al-Ahzaab, 33:32)||<li>Allah ﷻ warns them against using suggestive gestures and manner of walking or displaying their charms and some of their ornaments: “They should not strike their feet in order to draw attention to their hidden ornaments .” (Soorat An-Noor, 24:31)||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"3\">Avoiding Private Seclusion with Non-MahramWomen Altogether (Khalwah)||<p>The Arabic word khalwah means the state of being alone with a non-mahram woman in a place where no one can see them.

(See page 202)||<p>Indeed, Islam attaches much importance to marriage rulings, etiquette and the spouses’ rights in such a way as to guarantee marital stability and permanence and create a successful family in which children are brought up enjoying psychological stability, observing devoutness and moral integrity, and displaying excellence in various aspects of life.||<p> ||<p class=\"style1\">These rulings include the following:||<p>Islam has laid down several conditions for the validity of the marriage contract. They are as follows:||<h3>The Conditions Islam Stipulates Regarding the Wife||<ol>||<li>The wife must be Muslim, Jewish or Christian, believing in her religion. However, Islam encourages Muslim men to choose devout Muslim women for this purpose because a practising Muslim will be a good mother who will give her children the best possible upbringing and help her husband adhere to the teachings of Islam. As the Prophet ﷺ said, “Marry a devout Muslim woman and you will prosper.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 4802; Saheeh Muslim: 1466)||<li>She must be a chaste woman, as it is forbidden to marry a woman known for her lewdness and immorality. As the Qur’an states, “It is lawful for you to marry the chaste believing women and the chaste women of the people who were given the Book before you.” (Soorat Al-Maa’idah, 5:5)||<li>She must not be one of those women whom he is never permitted to marry at any time in his life whatsoever (mahram) (See page 206), nor must he marry two sisters at the same time or a woman and her aunt at the same time.||<h3>The Conditions Islam Stipulates Regarding the Husband||<p>The husband must be Muslim, and a Muslim woman is forbidden from marrying a non-Muslim man, no matter what his religion may be and whether he is a member of the People of the Book (i.e. Jewish or Christian)or not. Islam stresses that a man must be accepted as a husband as long as he meets the following two conditions:||<ul>||<li class=\"style3\">Adherence to religion||<li class=\"style3\">Good character||<p>The Prophet ﷺ said, “If a man with whose religion and character you are satisfied asks your daughter’s hand in marriage, comply with his request.” (Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 1084; Sunan Ibn Maajah: 1967)",
        "title2": "The Wife’s Rights",
        "body2": "<h2>The Spouses’ Rights and Obligations||<p>Allah ﷻ has entitled husband and wife to certain rights, made it incumbent upon both of them to discharge their duties and encourages them to engage in anything that is bound to promote marital life and preserve it. Indeed, they are both responsible for the welfare of the family and neither of them should demand the other to do something beyond their capacity, as the Qur’an states, “And women have rights similar to those of men over them in kindness.” (Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2:228) Therefore, tolerance and kindness are required to create a prosperous life and help build a strong family.||<h3>The Wife’s Rights||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"1\">Maintenance and Residence||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 260px; height: 173px; right: 4px; top: 0px;\">||<caption>A Muslim man is duty-bound to support his wife and children in kindness.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/market.jpg\" />||<ul>||<li>The wife’s maintenance entails her incontestable right to food, drink, clothing, general care and a suitable home, even if she is wealthy. ||<li>How is the amount of maintenance calculated? The husband ought to spend on his wife in accordance with his means without extravagance or miserliness, as the Qur’an states, “Let the man of means spend according to his means: and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him.”(Soorat At-Talaaq, 65:7)||<li>He must spend on her in kindness, without ever implying that he is doing her favours or humiliating her in any way whatsoever. Indeed, such maintenance is not a favour but a duty he ought to discharge towards his wife in kindness, as the Qur’an clearly exhorts him.||<li>When a Muslim man fulfils his duty of supporting his wife and children, he will be rewarded abundantly by Allah, as the Prophet ﷺ said, “When a man spends on his family, anticipating Allah’s reward in the hereafter, this act of his will be counted as an act of charity.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 4776; Saheeh Muslim: 1401) He also said, “You will be rewarded for whatever you spend for Allah’s sake even if it were a morsel of food which you put in your wife’s mouth.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 56; Saheeh Muslim: 1628) Those who refuse, or neglect their duty to spend on their families despite their ability to do so committing a terrible sin for their negligence, as the Prophet ﷺ said, “A man who neglects those who are under his care would surely be committing a sin.” (Sunan Abu Daawood: 1692)||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"2\">Living with Them in Kindness||<p>This means showing good character, kindness, gentleness in word and deed and putting up with the occasional faults and negligence. As the Qur’an states, “Live together with them courteously and in kindness. If you dislike them, it may well be that you dislike something in which Allah has placed a lot of good.” (Soorat An-Nisaa’, 4:19)||<p>The Prophet ﷺ said, “The believers who have perfect faith are those with the best character, and the best of them are those who treat their women the best.” (Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 1162)||<p>“The believers who have perfect faith are those with the best character, and the best among you are those who treat their wives the best.” (Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 2612; Musnad Ahmad: 24677)||<p>The best of you are the kindest towards their wives, and I am the kindest amongst you to my wives.” (Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 3895)||<p>One of the Prophet’s companions once asked him, “Messenger of Allah, what is the right the wife of one of us has on him?” he said, “To feed her whenever you feed yourself and to clothe her whenever you clothe yourself; do not slap her across the face, revile her or separate yourself from her except in the house.”(Sunan Abu Daawood: 2142)||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"3\">Patience and Tolerance||<p>A man must make allowances for women’s nature, which is obviously different from that of men;he must also try to look at life from all sides, considering the advantages and disadvantages of his wife, for no one is free from faults. Both spouses must exercise patience and take into account the positive aspects of each other’s personality, as the Qur’an states, “Do not forget to show kindness to each other.” (Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2:237) The Prophet ﷺ also said in this respect, “A believer must not harbour any rancour against a believing woman; if he dislikes one of her characteristics, he will certainly be pleased with another.” (Saheeh Muslim: 1469)||<p>The Prophet ﷺ urges men to treat women with kindness, pointing their attention to the fact that women’s emotional and psychological nature is different from that of men, that such differences between men and women are in actual fact complementary and must in no way give rise to discord and eventual divorce. The Prophet ﷺ said, “Treat women well and with kindness, for a woman was created from the rib and thus she will not be straightened according to your way. If you want to enjoy her, you will have to enjoy her with her twist. If you try to straighten her, you will break her, and breaking her is divorcing her.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 3153; Saheeh Muslim: 1468)||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"4\">Spending the Night with the Wife||<p>The husband is recommended to spend the night with his wife and must do so at least once every four days. He must also observe equal division of nights between co-wives in cases of polygamy.||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"5\">Defending Her, Representing His Honour||<p>When a man marries a woman, she becomes his ‘honour’ which he must stubbornly defend even if he gets killed in the process, as the Prophet ﷺ said, “Whoever is killed defending his wife is a martyr.” (Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 1421; Sunan Abu Daawood: 4772)||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"6\">Not Revealing Bedroom Secrets||<p>The husband must not talk to others about his wife’s particularities and bedroom secrets to other people. The Prophet ﷺ said, “The worst person in the eyes of Allah on the Day of Judgement is that couple who have an intimate relationship with each other and the man then reveals their bedroom secrets to others.” (Saheeh Muslim: 1437)||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"7\">Not Engaging in Aggressive or Hostile Actions against her||<p>To solve marital problems, Islam has laid down a number of rules, including the following:||<ul>||<li>Problems may be solved through constructive dialogue and wisdom in order to correct mistakes.||<li>In cases of rebellion, disloyalty and ill-conduct, the husband may stop talking to her, but without exceeding three days; if this course of action does not seem to work, then he may temporarily abandon her in bed or abstain from the usual sexual intimacy, but without leaving the house.||<li>‛Aa’ishah ~ narrated, “Allah’s Messenger ﷺ never hit anything with his hand ever, except when fighting in the path of Allah. Nor did he ever hit a servant or a woman.” (Saheeh Muslim: 2328)||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"8\">Teaching and Advising Her ||<p>The husband must enjoin his family members to act rightly and forbid them to act inappropriately. He ought to strive hard to help them follow the path that leads to Paradise and avoid those paths that lead to Hellfire. Teaching them by precept and example, he can do so by acting on obeying Allah’s commands and avoiding things He has prohibited. The wife must also advise her husband, guide him to the right path and discuss with him ways of giving the best possible upbringing to their children. As the Qur’an states, “O You who believe, safeguard yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones.” (Soorat At-Tahreem, 66:6) The Prophet ﷺ also said in this regard, “Every one of you is a guardian and is responsible for those in his custody.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 2416; Saheeh Muslim: 1829)||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"9\">Honouring the Conditions Stipulated by the Wife||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 150px;\">||<caption>The husband must honour the marriage contract and fulfil the conditions stipulated in it.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/ring.jpg\" />||<p>If the wife makes a stipulation at the time of concluding the marriage contract, such as having a particular kind of accommodation or expenses and the husband agrees to such a condition, he must fulfil such an obligation, for a marriage contract is one of the most solemn agreements and obligations. The Prophet ﷺ said, “Of all the conditions which you have to fulfil, the conditions which make it legal for you to have sexual relations (i.e. the marriage contract) have the greatest right to be fulfilled.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 4856; Saheeh Muslim: 1418)",

        "body3": "<div id=\"dotted-box\">||<h4>The Husband’s Rights||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"1\">Obedience in Kindness||<p>Allah ﷻ has placed men in charge of women, being responsible for their maintenance, guidance and general care, due to the characteristics with which He has endowed them, in addition to the money they spend to support them. As the Qur’an states, “Men have charge of women because Allah has preferred the one above the other and because they spend their wealth on them.” (Soorat An-Nisaa’, 4:34)||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"2\">Attentiveness to His Sexual Needs||<p>A Muslim woman must be attentive to her husband’s sexual needs and is recommended to beautify herself for him. If she refuses to respond to his legitimate sexual advances, she would be committing a monstrous sin, unless there is a legitimate excuse, such as being on her menses, making up an obligatory fast she has previously missed or being sick.\\r The Prophet ﷺ said, “If a man calls his wife to bed and she refuses, and then he spends the night angry with her, the angels will continue to curse her until the mofning.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 3065; Saheeh Muslim: 1436).||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"3\">Not Allowing Anyone He Does not Like in His House||<p>This is his right which she must respect.

However, should there be a genuine need for divorce, Islam requires them to follow certain rules it has laid down in this respect.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/broken.jpg\" />||<p>Islam urges that the marriage contract be permanent and that the marriage relationship be characterised by continuity so much so that husband and wife remain together until death separates them. Islam goes as far as to call marriage a “solemn pledge”. Specifying a date for terminating the marriage contract is strictly prohibited.||<p>While Islam stresses all this, it does, however, take into account the fact that it lays down rules and regulations for human beings with frailties that characterise human nature, and so it lays down rules and regulations as to how a divorce may be negotiated after all efforts of reconciliation have been exhausted and there is no other recourse. In this way, it deals fairly and in a practical manner with both spouses. When aversion and conflicts between spouses persistently become intolerable, divorce becomes a necessity for the prosperity and familial and social stability for each one of them. The reason for such an inevitable course of action explains the failure of marriage to realize its purpose, hence dissolution of marriage becomes the lesser of two evils.||<p>It is for this reason that Islam allows marriage dissolution through divorce as a means to end an unsuccessful marriage and to give each spouse the chance to find another spouse for a better relationship. As the Qur’an states, “If a couple do separate, Allah will enrich each of them from His boundless wealth. Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Wise.” (Soorat An-Nisaa’, 4:130)||<p class=\"style1\">However, it has laid down a number of rules and criteria concerning divorce, including the following:||<ul>||<li>As a general rule, divorce rests with the husband except under certain circumstances. ||<li>The wife may request a divorce from the judge if she cannot bear to live with her husband any longer for legitimate reasons and the latter refuses to divorce her. The judge then undertakes to dissolve the marriage contract if the reason for requesting a divorce is acceptable.||<li>A husband can remarry his wife after a second divorce; however, if he divorces her a third time, he cannot possibly remarry her unless she marries another man who has genuinely divorced her.||",

The Prophet ﷺ said, “A parent is the middle gate of all the gates of Paradise.

In this case, he must not obey them but must still be kind to them, as the Qur’an states, “We have instructed man to honour his parents, but if they endeavour to make you associate with Me something about which you have no knowledge, do not obey them.” (Soorat Al-‛Ankaboot, 29:8)||<ul>||<li class=\"style3\">Showing kindness to them in their old age||<p>Allah ﷻ says, “Your Lord has decreed that you should worship none but Him, and that you should show kindness to your parents. Whether one or both of them reach old age with you, do not utter the slightest harsh word to them out of irritation and do not be harsh with them but speak to them with gentleness and generosity.” (Soorat Al-Israa’, 17:23)||<p>This verse informs us that a Muslim must honour his parents and obey them and that he must not repel them especially if they have attained old age, even by muttering sounds to express annoyance, let alone saying a word of contempt.||<ul>||<li class=\"style3\">Non-Muslim parents||<p>A Muslim is required to obey his parents and show kindness to them even if they are not Muslim, as the Qur’an states, “But if they strive with you to make you associate with Me something of which you certainly have no knowledge do not obey them.

        "title1": "The Position of Good Character in Islam",
        "body1": "<h2>The Position of Good Character in Islam||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"1\">Perfection of noble character was one of the most important objectives of the Prophet’s mission||<p>Allah ﷻ says, “It is He who raised up among the unlettered [Arabs] a Messenger from them to recite His verses to them and purify them and teach them the Book and Wisdom, even though before that they were clearly misguided.” (Soorat Al-Jumu‛ah, 62:2) This verse reveals one of the favours Allah ﷻ has bestowed on the believers, stating that He has sent them His Messenger, Muhammad ﷺ, to teach them the Qur’an and to purify them. Purification can only be attained by purging one’s heart from such imperfections as associating others with Allah in worship, having bad moral character like hatred and jealousy and ridding one’s speech and deeds of all forms of evil practices. The Prophet ﷺ once declared, “I have been sent to perfect noble character.”<em> (Sunan Al-Bayhaqee: 21301)</em> This statement makes it clear that one of the reasons behind the Prophet’s mission was to elevate and perfect the moral character of the individual and society at large.||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"2\">Noble character is part and parcel of faith and belief||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 230px; height: 261px;\">||<caption>Perfection of noble character was one of the most important objectives of the Prophet’s mission.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/hiraa.jpg\" />||<p>When asked about the best of the believers, the Prophet ﷺ replied, “They are those who have the best character and manners.”<em> (Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 1162; Sunan Abu Daawood: 4682)</em>\\r In fact, the Qur’an uses the comprehensive Arabic word birr to refer to faith. As the Qur’an states, “Righteousness (birr) does not lie in turning your faces [during prayer] to the East or to the West. Rather, those with true devoutness are the ones who believe in Allah, the Last Day, the angels, the Book and the Prophets…” <em>(Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2:177)</em> The word birr is a rather comprehensive term which includes all forms of righteousness, in word and deed. It is for this reason that the Prophet ﷺ said, “Righteousness (birr) is good character.” <em>(Saheeh Muslim: 2553)</em>\\r This becomes clear in the Prophet’s declaration: “Faith (eemaan) has sixty odd branches. The uppermost of all these is the Testimony of Faith: Laa ilaaha illallaah (There is no god worthy of worship except Allah) while the least of them is the removal of a harmful object from the road. Shyness is a branch of faith.” <em>(Saheeh Muslim: 35)</em>||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"3\">Noble character permeates all acts of worship||<p>Every time Allah commands the believers to perform an act of worship, He draws their attention to its moral significance or its positive effect on the individual and society. Examples of this are numerous and include the following:\\r The Prayer: “Establish the prayer, for the prayer restrains from shameful and unjust deeds.” <em>(Soorat Al-‛Ankaboot, 29:45).</em>\\r The Obligatory Charity Payment (Zakaat): “Take zakaat from their wealth to purify and cleanse themwith it.” (Soorat At-Tawbah: 9:103) Besides showing kindness and giving comfort to people, zakaat refines benefactor’s character and purges it from evil practices. \\r Fasting: O You who believe, fasting has been prescribed for you just as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may remain conscious of Allah.” <em>(Soorat Al-Baqarah: 183)</em> This verse makes it abundantly clear that the foremost objective of fasting is to realise consciousness of Allah by obeying His commands and avoiding all words and deeds He has prohibited. As the Prophet ﷺ said, “ Whoever does not abandon false speech and false conduct, then Allah has no need of his abandoning of food and drink.” <em>(Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 1804)</em> Therefore, if fasting fails to effect a change in one’s character and dealings with others, it will by no means serve its real purpose.||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"4\">The immense rewards Allah ﷻ has in store for those who observe good character Textual proofs from the Qur’an and the Sunnah to this effect are numerous, including the following:||<ul>||<li class=\"style2\">Good character will be the heaviest righteous deed to be placed on a person’s scale of deeds on the Day of Judgement.\\r The Prophet ﷺ said, “No deed that will be placed on the scale of deeds [on the Day of Judgement] will be heavier than good character. Indeed, a person with good character will attain the rank of those with a good record of voluntary fasts and prayers.” <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 2003)</em>||<p> ||<ul>||<li class=\"style2\">It is the very deed that will lead people to enter Paradise the most.\\r When the Prophet ﷺ was asked about which act leads people to enter Paradise the most, he replied, “Piety and good character.”<em> (Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 2004; Sunan Ibn Maajah: 4246)</em>||<ul>||<li class=\"style2\">Of all people, those who have good character will be the closest to the Prophet ﷺ on the Day of Judgement.\\r The Prophet ﷺ said, “The dearest to me among you and the nearest to me on the Day of Judgement are those who have the best character.” <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 2018)</em>||<ul>||<li class=\"style2\">The Prophet ﷺ guarantees a house in the highest part of Paradise to those who have good character:\\r “I guarantee a house in the surroundings of Paradise for those who give up arguing, even if they are in the right; and I guarantee a house in the middle of Paradise for those who abandon lying even when joking; and I guarantee a house in the highest part of Paradise for those who have good character and manners.”<em> (Sunan Abu Daawood: 4800)</em>||<div>||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 266px;\">||<caption>Good character is one of the meritorious deeds in the sight of Allah and serves to give us a sense of inner fulfilment and happiness.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/teacher.jpg\" />||",

        "body2": "<h2>Distinguishing Features of Noble Character in Islam||<p>Noble character in Islam is characterised by unique qualities which distinguish it from all other faiths, including the following||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"1\">. Noble character is not confined to a particular type of people||<p>Almighty Allah has made people into different shapes, colours and languages. They are all equal in His sight, and no one has an advantage over another except in piety and noble conduct, as the Qur’an states, “O mankind, We have created you of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes that you may know one another; verily, the most honourable of you, in the sight of Allah, are the most pious of you.” <em>(Soorat Al-Hujuraat, 49:13)</em>\\r Indeed, noble character characterises Muslims’ relationship with all members of society: There is no difference whatsoever between rich and poor, black and white, Arab and non-Arab, or a prince and a pauper.||<h4>How to Treat Non-Muslims||<p>Allah ﷻ commands us to show kindness and courtesy to everyone without exception, for justice, kindness and mercy are aspects of good character which a Muslim observes in his words and deeds with Muslims and non-Muslims alike. A Muslim ought to embody good character traits as a means to call others to this great religion of Islam.\\r The Qur’an says, “Allah does not forbid you from being good to those who have not fought you on account of your religion or driven you from your homes, or from being just towards them. Allah loves those who are just.” <em>(Soorat Al-Mumtahinah, 60:8)</em>\\r Allah only forbids us to make friends with those belligerent non-Muslims who fight us because of our religion. He also forbids us to admire their way of life which clearly upholds unbelief and polytheist practices, as the Qur’an states, “Allah only forbids you respecting those who made war upon you on account of [your] religion, and drove you forth from your homes and backed up [others] in your expulsion, that you make friends with them. Whoever takes them for friends are wrongdoers.” <em>(Soorat Al-Mumtahinah, 60:9)</em>||<div>||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 300px;\">||<caption>A Muslim always maintains high moral standards when dealing with people regardless of their religion or race.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/kids.jpg\" />||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"2\">Noble character is not confined only to human beings||<h4>Good Treatment of animals||<p>The Prophet ﷺ once mentioned that a woman deserved punishment in Hellfire because of a cat that she had restrained and left it to starve to death. He also mentioned the story of a man whom Allah had forgiven after giving a thirsty dog some water to drink: “A woman entered Hellfire because of a cat which she had tied, neither giving it food nor setting it free to eat from the vermin of the earth.”<em>(Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 3140; Saheeh Muslim: 2619)</em>\\r He also said, “While a man was walking along a road, he became very thirsty and he found a well. He lowered himself into the well, drank and came out. Then he saw a dog panting and eating mud because of excessive thirst. The man said,‘This dog has become exhausted from thirst in the same way as I.’ He lowered himself into the well again and filled his shoe with water and gave the dog some water to drink. Allah thanked him for his good deed and forgave him.” The people asked, “Messenger of Allah! Is there a reward for us in serving these animals?” “Yes,” he replied, “There is a reward for serving every living thing.” <em>(Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 5663; Saheeh Muslim: 2244).</em>||<h4>Preservation of the environment||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 200px;\">||<caption>Islam urges its adherents to safeguard the environment.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/environment.jpg\" />||<p>Islam instructs us to make the world a better place by utilising theearth’s natural resources to build a civilization and engage in development and production for the general welfare of mankind, while at the same time trying to preserve such resources and prevent others from abusing or unnecessarily wasting them. Corruption in all its forms and by whatever means it may be caused is frowned upon in Islam and abhorred to the Creator Himself, as the Qur’an states, “Allah does not like corruption.”<em> (Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2:205)</em>\\r In fact, Islam is so concerned about this issue that it goes as far as to direct its adherents to do righteous deeds and engage in such things as cultivating the land even in times of great turmoil and under terrifying circumstances, such as the Day of Judgement. As the Prophet ﷺ once instructed, “If the Day of Judgement takes place [and you recognise the Event], while a man is holding a palm-tree seedling [to plant in the soil], let him, if he can, plant it.” <em>(Musnad Ahmad: 12981)</em>||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"3\">Noble character in all aspects of life||<h4>The Family||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 300px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/family.jpg\" />||<p>Islam stresses the importance of noble character among all members of the family, as the Prophet ﷺ said, “The best of you are those who treat their wives the best, and I am the best of you in this respect.”<em> (Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 3895)</em>||<ul>||<li>Despite being the best human being of all time, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ shared household chores with his wives and helped around the house, as ‛Aa’ishah <img src=\"/sites/all/libraries/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/img/radhia.png\" alt=\"May Allah be pleased with her\" title=\"May Allah be pleased with her\" class=\"isymbol\" border=\"0\" />, one of his wives, once said about him, “He used to help his wives with the housework.<em>”(Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 5048)</em>||<li>He also used to joke with his family members. ‛Aa’ishah ~ said, “I accompanied the Prophet ﷺ on a certain journey when I was young and thin. The Prophet ﷺ asked the people to move on, and they marched ahead. Then he turned to me and said, ‘Come on, let us have a race’. I raced him and I won the race. He did not mention this incident again.However, when I later put on more weight and I forgot all about this incident, I accompanied him again on some other journey. He asked the people to march ahead, and they did. Then he asked me to race him. I raced him, but he won. The Prophet laughed and said, ‘This was to make up for my previous defeat.<em>’”(Musnad Ahmad: 26277)</em>||<h4>Trade||<p>Because people’s love of wealth may get the better of them and prompt them to engage in forbidden practices, Islam stresses the importance of observing noble character which serves to put an end to such practices. The following are some examples of the points Islam stresses in this respect:||<ul>||<li>It warns traders who deal with fraud against a severe punishment on the Day of Judgement, as the Qur’an states, “Woe to those who give short measure or weight; those who, when they take a measure from people, exact full measure, but when they give them a measure or weight, hand over less than is due.”<em> (Soorat Al-Mutaffifeen, 83:3).</em>||<li>It urges traders to show kindness and leniency, as the Prophet ﷺ said, “May Allah have mercy on a man who is kind when he buys, when he sells and when he demands his due.”<em>(Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 1970)</em>||<h4>Industry||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 132px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/type.jpg\" />||<p>Islam advises workers to observe a number of ethical principles and standards, including the following:||<ul>||<li>To be as highly proficient at their jobs as they possibly can. The Prophet ﷺ said, “Allah likes to see that when you do something that you do it well.”<em> (Musnad Abu Ya‛laa: 4386, Al-Bayhaqee’sShu‛ab Al-Eemaan: 5313)</em>||<li>To honour their obligations, as the Prophet ﷺ said, “The signs of the hypocrite are three: when he speaks he lies, when he promises he breaks his promise and when he is entrusted he betrays the trust.”<em> (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 33)</em>||<li>||<li>||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"4\">Noble character under all circumstances||<p>There are no exceptions whatsoever when it comes to talking about good moral character in Islam. A Muslim is required to follow the dictates of Islamic law and observe noble character even in times of war and in difficult times, for there is no such thing in Islam as the end justifies the means. In other words, bad or unfair methods of doing something are by no means acceptable even if the result of that action is good or positive.\\r It is for this reason that Islam has laid down rules and criteria which govern Muslims’ behaviour even in times of war so that they would not succumb to fits of rage, driven by intolerance which feeds their anger and satisfies hatred and malicious and selfish tendencies.",

Once, a man came and said, “who amongst you is Muhammed?” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 63) \\r||<li>Anas ibn Maalik  said, “Any of the female slaves of Madeenah could take hold of the hand of Allah’s Messenger and take him wherever she wished.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 5724) The expression “take hold of the hand of Allah’s Messenger” is an indication of his extreme kindness and prompt response to the young and the weak. This report reveals the Prophet’s utter humility, in that it mentions his readiness to attend to the needs of some of the most vulnerable members of society, women and female slaves.\\r||<li>Once he declared, “A person who has an atom’s weight of pride in his heart will not enter Paradise.” (Saheeh Muslim: 91)\\r||",

Be merciful to those on the earth and the One above the heavens will have mercy on you.” (Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 1924; Sunan Abu Daawood: 4941)\\r||<p class=\"style1\">His mercy embraced countless aspects, including the following:\\r||<h4>Mercy towards children\\r||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\" width:210px; height:315px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/father.jpg\"/>||<ul>||<li>A Bedouin once came to the Prophet ﷺ and said, “Do you kiss your children? We do not kiss them.” The Prophet ﷺ said, “Can I put mercy in your heart after Allah has removed it?” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 5652; Saheeh Muslim: 2317)\\r||<p>On another occasion, a man saw the Prophet ﷺ kissing his grandson, Al-Hasan ibn ‛Ali, and said to him, “I have ten children, but I have never kissed any of them.” The Prophet ﷺ looked disapprovingly at him and said, “He who does not show mercy to others will not be shown mercy.” (Saheeh Muslim: 2318)\\r||<ul>||<li>Once he carried his granddaughter Zaynab while standing in prayer, and he put her down gently when he prostrated. (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 494, Saheeh Muslim: 543)\\r||<li>If he heard a baby crying while the mother was praying behind him, he would shorten the prayer so that the mother could attend to the baby’s needs. Abu Qataadah  narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said, “When I begin the prayer, I always intend to make it long; however, if I hear a baby crying, I shorten it, as I do not wish to cause his mother any distress.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 675; Saheeh Muslim: 470)\\r||<h4>Mercy towards Women\\r||<p>The Prophet ﷺ urged his companions to look after girls and show kindness to them; he used to say, “Whoever is in charge of any of these girls and treats them well, they will be a shield for him against the Fire.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 5649; Saheeh Muslim: 2629)\\r||He even stressed that women must be given their rights and be well cared for and commanded Muslims to make this issue their concern and to advise one another to do so: “Take good care of women.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 4890)\\r||He was a shining example of kindness to family members.

(Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 5661; Saheeh Muslim: 2982)\\r||<li>He regarded showing kindness to the weak members of society and giving them their rights a strong reason to gain Allah’s victory over the enemy as well as gaining more means of subsistence: “Seek help among your weak ones, for you are given provision and help only because of the weak amongst you.”(Sunan Abu Daawood: 2594)\\r|| <p> ||<h4> Mercy towards animals\\r||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\" width:220px; height:156px;\">||<a class=\"mosaic-overlay\" style=\"height:160px; bottom:-155px;\">||<div class=\"details\">||<p> Once, seeing a mother bird flapping its wings in desperation after some of his companions had taken some of its chicks away, the Prophet ﷺ disapprovingly said to them, “Who has distressed this bird by taking her young?

He urged people to show kindness to animals and warned them against harming them or laying loads on them which are more than they can bear. He said, “Allah has prescribed proficiency in all things. Thus, if you kill, kill well; and if you slaughter, slaughter well. Let each one of you sharpen his blade and let him spare suffering to the animal he slaughters.” (Saheeh Muslim: 1955)\\r||<li>Once he noticed a mound of ants which had been burned up. “Who has set fire to this?” he asked.

The man then said to him, “Spend in charity without fearing poverty, for the Lord of the Mighty Throne will not decrease your wealth.” The Prophet ﷺ smiled and his face was radiant with happiness.

They drove him to a tree where one of the uncouth Bedouins snatched his mantle off his shoulders, thinking it was part of the spoils of war. “Give me back my mantle,” he said, “for if I had as many camels as the trees [around here], I would divide them all among you. You know very well that I am neither miserly, nor deceitful, nor cowardly.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 2847)\\r|| <p class=\"style2\">May Allah’s peace and blessings be upon Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, for he is indeed the epitome of excellent moral character in all aspects of life.\\r|| ||",

The shahaadah is the first and most important of the five pillars of Islam and consists of two parts, namely:||<ol>||<li>Ashhadu an laailaaha illallaah: This means: I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah; I worship Him alone without associating any partners with Him in worship.||<li>Wa ash hadu anna Muhammad an rasool-ullaah: This means: And I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah whom Allah has sent to all mankind; I will obey his commands and avoid anything he has forbidden and worship Allah according to His law and the teachings of His Messenger ﷺ. <em>(See page 42-50)</em>||<h4>Taking a Bath:||<p>The very moment a person embraces Islam is doubtless the greatest moment in his life, for it signifies his real birth through which he has come to understand the real reason behind his existence in this life.

A person who talks about his past sins and brags about committing them is in no way considered penitent. As the Prophet ﷺ once stated, “Remorse is repentance.” <em>(Sunan Ibn Maajah: 4252)</em>||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"3\">To sincerely resolve not to commit it again||<p>Sincere repentance cannot possibly take place if a penitent person intends to repeat the sin.||<h3>Steps towards Acquiring Determination||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block-white bar\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 185px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/DPP07DA0B13111856.jpg\" />||<ul>||<li>Pledging oneself not to repeat the sin under any circumstances and obstacles, not even for an instant, for the Prophet ﷺ said, “Whoever possesses the following three qualities will relish the sweetness of faith.” Of these three characteristics, he mentioned “to hate to return to unbelief (kufr) after Allah has saved him from it, as much as he would hate to be thrown into the Fire.” <em>(Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 21; Saheeh Muslim: 43)</em>||<li>Keeping away from people and places that are bound to decrease his faith and tempt him to commit sins.||<li>Repeatedly begging Allah ﷻ to keep him on the right path and adhere firmly to Islam until death, in any language or form. Examples from the Qur’an and the Prophet’s Sunnah include the following:||<ul>||<li>“Rabbanaa laa tuzigh quloobanaa ba‛da idh hadaytanaa” (Our Lord, do not make our hearts deviate after You have guided us) <em>(SooratAal-‛Imraan, 3:8)</em>||<li>“Yaa muqallibal-quloob, Thabbit qalbee ‛alaa deenik” (O Allah, Controller of hearts, make my heart adhere firmly to Your religion) <em>(Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 2140)</em>||",

Truly Allah forgives all wrong actions. He is the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.’” <em>(Soorat Az-Zumar, 39:53)</em>\\r After a person sincerely repents to Allah, Allah ﷻ will definitely pardon him and forgive his sins; in addition, He will reward him; immensely: He will change his bad deeds into good ones, as the Qur’an states, “Except for those who repent, believe and act rightly: Allah will transform the wrong actions of such people into good — Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” <em>(Soorat Al-Furqaan,25:70)</em>\\r As this a reward is immense indeed, a sensible person ought to maintain such repentance and spare no effort to avoid falling into Satan’s trap which will negatively affect his faith.||<h3>Sweetness of Faith||<p>Those who will most certainly taste the sweetness of faith, experience deep tranquillity and take great delight in experiencing closeness to Allah are those who love Allah ﷻ and His Messenger ﷺ more than anyone or anything else, love others, commensurate with their closeness to Allah and dedication to Islam, and hate to convert to unbelief just as they hate to be punished in Hellfire. The Prophet ﷺ said, “Any person who combines these three qualities will certainly experience the sweetness of faith: (1) that Allah and His Messenger are dearer to him than anything else; (2) that his love of others is purely for Allah’s sake; and (3) that he hates to relapse into unbelief as much as he hates to be cast into the Fire.” <em>(Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 21; Saheeh Muslim: 43)</em>||<div>||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 565px; height: 259px;\">||<caption>A Muslim relishes the sweetness of faith when he hates to relapse into unbelief just as much as he hates to be thrown into the Fire.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/mosque@night.jpg\" />||",

Islam is undeniably the best gift to mankind, for it is not a mere set of abstract ideology, nor is it a hobby which a person may practise whenever he feels like it; rather, it is a religion and a way of life which governs a Muslim’s life in all its aspects without exception. Commanding His Messenger ﷺ to stubbornly hold fast to Islam and the teachings of the Qur’an, being on the right path, Allah ﷻ says in the Qur’an, “So hold fast to what has been revealed to you. You are on a straight path.” <em>(Soorat Az-Zukhrf, 43:43)</em>||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block-white bar\" style=\"width: 260px; height: 365px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/hijab-quran.jpg\" />||<p>A Muslim must not feel sad if he experiences any form of hardship, for it is part of Allah’s wise plan to test His servants. Allah ﷻ even tested His prophets and messengers, who are far better than us, and the Qur’an tells us how they encountered untold suffering at the hands of relatives and enemies alike, without losing heart, weakening in their faith or wavering under adversity. The great hardship a Muslim faces due to his dedication to the truth is one of the ways Allah ﷻ tests His servants’ faith. Therefore, live up to your lofty principles, try your best to pass the test, adhere to the truth under all circumstances and constantly pray to Allah to keep you on the right path, just as the Prophet ﷺ himself did. Repeat the supplication: “Yaa muqallibal-quloob, Thabbit qalbee‛alaa deenik” (O Allah, Controller of hearts, make my heart adhere firmly to Your religion).<em> (Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 2140)</em>||<p>Allah ﷻ says in this context, “Do people think that once they say, ‘We believe,’ they will be left alone and not be put to the test? We certainly tried those who have gone before them, so Allah will certainly distinguish between those who are truthful and those who are lying.” <em>(Soorat Al-‛Ankaboot,29:2-3)</em>||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"2\">Doing One’s Best to Call to Islam with Wisdom and fair Admonition||<p>Engaging in da‛wah work (calling others to Islam) is undoubtedly one of the best ways of expressing gratitude to Allah as well as one of the most effective means to remain constant in faith. If a person recovers from a life-threatening disease which has caused him a great deal of suffering and misery after discovering the right cure for his disease, he will certainly spread such a remedy amongst people, particularly amongst his relatives and closest friends.

Evidence to this effect includes the following:||<ol>||<li>Da‛wah is the means to success in this life and in the hereafter, as the Qur’an states, “Let there be a group among you who call others to good, and enjoin what is right, and forbid what is wrong: those who do this shall be successful.” <em>(Soorat Aal ‛Imraan,3:104)</em>||<li>No one has a better speech than that of those who engage in da‛wah activities. Commending such people, the Qur’an says, “Who speaks better than one who calls to Allah, does good works and says, ‘I am surely one of the Muslims.’?” <em>(Soorat Fussilat, 41:33)</em> It is clear, therefore, that there is no one whose speech is better than that of a person who calls people to the truth, for he is their guide to their Creator and Lord and the one who takes them out of the darkness of misguidance into the light of faith.||<li>Engaging in da‛wah work testifies to one’s compliance with Allah’s command: “Call to the way of your Lord with wisdom and fair admonition, and argue with them in the best manner possible.”<em> (Soorat An-Nahl, 16:125)</em> A person who dedicates himself to such a noble task must invite others to Islam with wisdom, making sure that he knows the personality of the people he wants to call to Islam so as to choose the best possible method to carry out the task, all the while arguing with them in the kindest, most gracious manner which appeals to them.||<li>Engaging in da‛wah work was the very task carried out by all of Allah’s messengers without exception, foremost of whom was Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, whom Allah sent to all mankind as a witness over people, giving news to the believers of immense reward in the hereafter, warning the unbelievers against severe punishment and spreading his light to all mankind. The Qur’an says, “Prophet, We have sent you as a witness, as a bearer of good news and a warner, and a caller to Allah by His permission and a light-giving lamp. Convey to the believers the good news that they will receive immense favour from Allah.” <em>(Soorat Al-Ahzaab,33:45-47)</em>||<li>Inviting people to Islam is the source of unlimited goodness; for each person you invite to Islam, you will get the same rewards for his prayer, worship and teaching others. What a great blessing Allah bestows on those who engage in da‛wah work! The Prophet ﷺ said, “Whoever calls to guidance will have a reward similar to that of those who follow it, without the reward of either of them being lessened at all.” <em>(Saheeh Muslim: 2674)</em>||<li>The rewardAllah has in store for those who invite others to Islam is far better than all the enjoyments of the present world, for such a reward is from Allah Himself, the Most Generous, who will recompense them abundantly for such a noble endeavour: “If you turn away from me, remember I ask no reward from you. Only Allah will reward me, and I have been commanded to submit completely to Him.” <em>(Soorat Yoonus, 10:72)</em>\\r The Prophet ﷺ also said in this respect, “If Allah guides one man through you, this will be better for you than possessing red camels.” <em>(Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 2847;</em> <em>Saheeh Muslim:</em> <em>2406)</em> Camels were considered the most valuable property in ancient Arabia and the red variety was the most prized of all.||",
        "title2": "Requirements of the Correct Manner of Inviting Others to Islam",
        "body2": "<h3>Requirements of the Correct Manner of Inviting Others to Islam||<p>Allah ﷻ describes the correct manner of engaging in da‛wah work as one which is characterised by certain qualities which distinguish it from others. These qualities are as follows:||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"1\">Insight and Knowledge||<p>A caller to Islam (daa‛iyah) must be knowledgeable about the truth to which he invites others, clearly presenting divine instructions to them, based on clear evidence: “Say: This is my Way: I invite to Allah, on the basis of a clear proof, and so do those who follow me .” <em>(Soorat Yusuf, 12:108)</em>\\r He does not have to know many things before he starts calling people to Islam. Whenever he learns something new, he has to teach it to others. For instance, If he learns about the necessity of not associating anyone in the worship of Allah, he ought to convey this information to others. Likewise, if he learns about some aspects of the beauty of Islam, he must convey this to them. To put it in a nutshell, he must convey anything he learns about Islam, even if what he has learned is one single verse of the Qur’an, as the Prophet ﷺ once ordered, “Convey what you learn from me [to others], even if [what you have learnt] is one verse of the Qur’an.” <em>(Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 3274)</em>\\r This was the very practice of the Prophet’s companions; they would learn the principles of Islam in a few days and then they would go back to their people to call them to Islam and arouse their interest in it, especially through their high moral character.||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"2\">Wisdom||<p>The Qur’an says, “Call to the way of your Lord with wisdom and fair admonition, and argue with them in the best manner possible.” <em>(Soorat An-Nahl, 16:125)</em> Wisdom is the ability to make sensible decisions and give good advice at the appropriate time and place because of the experience and knowledge one has. \\r Given the differences between people regarding their character and level of understanding, a caller to Islam must choose the appropriate method to engage in da‛wah work and wait for the appropriate opportunity to win them over.\\r He must approach them with gentleness and compassion, and engage in a calm and balanced dialogue which does not instigate ill feelings and inflame hatred. It is for this reason that Allah ﷻ reminds His Messenger ﷺ of the favours He bestowed upon him by making him gentle with people: “It is by Allah’s grace that you deal gently with them; had you been harsh and hard-hearted, they would surely have deserted you.” <em>(Soorat Aal-‛Imraan, 3:159)</em>",
        "title3": "Inviting Family Members and Relatives to Islam",
        "body3": "<h2>Inviting Family Members and Relatives to Islam||<p class=\"style1\">A person who has been guided to Islam must do his best to call his family members and relatives to this religion, because they are the closest and dearest people to him. He ought to endure any harm he may encounter patiently whilst doing so. He should also use all possible means in order to show them the truth. As the Qur’an states, “Instruct your family to offer their prayers, and be steadfast in observing them yourself.” <em>(Soorat Taa Haa, 20:132)</em>||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 230px; height: 252px;\">||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/protect-your-house.jpg\" />||<p>Some callers to Islam may find that people to whom they are not related favourably respond to the invitation, whilst their closest relatives refuse to do so, which causes them a great deal of distress and disappointment. A successful caller to Islam, however, never gives up hope; he tries his best to guide them to the truth, using various methods and techniques and praying to Allah to guide their hearts, even under the bleakest of circumstances.\\r The Prophet ﷺ did just that with his Uncle Abu Taalib. He left no stone unturned in calling him to Islam and continued doing so until the last moments of his life. When Abu Taalib was on his deathbed, the Prophet ﷺ begged him, “Dear uncle, say, laa ilaaha illallaah, (There is no god worthy of worship except Allah) so that I may be able to intercede for you on the Day of Judgement.”<em>(Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: 3671;Saheeh Muslim: 24)</em>AbuTaalib, however, declined to do so, and so he died a polytheist. It was on this occasion that Allah ﷻ revealed the following verse: ‘‘You cannot guide whoever you please: it is Allah who guides whom He will. He knows best those who receive guidance.”<em> (Soorat Al-Qasas, 28:56)</em>\\r A new Muslim, as soon as he embraces Islam, must build a strong and healthy relationship with his relatives and acquaintances, Muslims and non-Muslims alike. He must also observe high moral standards when dealing with them, for Islam is not a call to isolation and withdrawal from social life.\\r Indeed, showing kindness to people and observing high moral standards when dealing with them is the best way to introduce them to this great religion with which Prophet Muhammad ﷻ was sent to perfect noble character.\\r Observance of high moral standards and good treatment must start at home, amongst family members.",

He sat by his head and said, “Become a Muslim.” The boy looked at his father who was also sitting by his head. His father said to him, “Obey Abul-Qaasim r .” The boy then embraced Islam.

The only blessing that is bound to bring about happiness and tranquillity in this life and eternal bliss in the hereafter is the blessing of being a Muslim, which is undeniably the greatest blessing Allah has ever bestowed upon us.||<p>It is for this reason that Allah attributes this blessing to Him, giving it great honour over other blessings, as the Qur’an states, “Today I have perfected your religion for you, completed My blessing upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.” (Soorat Al-Maa’idah, 5:3)||<p>It is for this reason that Allah attributes this blessing to Him, giving it great honour over other blessings, as the Qur’an states, “Today I have perfected your religion for you, completed My blessing upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.” (Soorat Al-Maa’idah, 5:3)||<p>How great Allah’s blessings upon us are!

It is worth noting here, however, that worship, or ‛ibaadah, in Islam does not imply abandonment of the life of the world and its pleasures. It is a comprehensive term which includes, in addition to such acts of worship as prayer, fasting and the obligatory charity (zakaat), all human acts as long as they are done for the sake of Allah, as the prophet ﷺ once observed, “You will be rewarded even when you engage in sexual intercourse with your wives.” In this way, worship, despite being the main purpose behind human existence, becomes the essence of life, affording a Muslim the opportunity to turn all daily lawful practices into great acts of worship. The Qur’an says, “Say: ‘My prayer and my sacrifice, my living and my dying, are for Allah alone, the Lord of all the worlds.’” (Soorat Al-An‛aam, 6:162) ",

It is in utter harmony with the pure natural disposition upon which Allah originated man, making him his own master and enabling him to exchange the servitude to false gods for the perfect freedom of worshipping Allah alone.",

        "body1": "<h2>Islam Is a Religion of Life||<p>Islam is a religion which balances the worldly life and the life to come. According to Islam, the worldly life is like a farm in which a Muslim sows the seeds of good deeds in all aspects of life in order to reap the rewards of his hard work both in this life and the hereafter. This endeavour requires an optimistic attitude, dedication, seriousness and determination, which is obvious in the following points:||<h3>Developing the Earth||<p>The Qur’an says, “He brought you into being from the earth and made you its inhabitants.” (Soorat Hood, 11:61) Allah ﷻ created us and placed us on this earth, commanding us to develop it and establish a civilisation to benefit humanity in a way that does not contradict Islamic teachings. Indeed, He considers doing so an act of worship for which its doer will be rewarded, even if it is done in times of great turmoil and under terrifying circumstances, such as the Day of Judgement. The prophet ﷺ once said, “If the Day of Judgement takes place [and you recognize the Event], while a man is holding a palm-tree seedling [to plant in the soil], let him, if he can, plant it.” (Musnad Ahmad: 2712)||<h3>Maintaining Social Relationships||<p>Islam calls its adherents to cooperate with people around them, regardless of their culture and religion, in order to establish a civilisation and build a healthy society. It urges them to associate with them and build relationships of the highest order, governed by the sublime moral standards Islam teaches. It also warns them against isolation and withdrawal from society, considering such a course to go against the right method naturally adopted by those dedicated to preaching Islam and calling to its sublime principles. Indeed, the prophet ﷺ once observed that a believer who mixes with people and endures their harm is far better than one who does not associate with them altogether. (Sunan Ibn Maajah: 4032)||<h3>Knowledge Acquisition||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 260px; height: 220px;\">||<caption> Islam has never witnessed a conflict between religion and science, as is the case in other religions.||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/scines_0.jpg\" />||<p>It was not a coincidence that the first word revealed to the prophet ﷺ was ‘Read’. In fact, Islam stresses the importance of acquiring beneficial knowledge in all fields of human interest and considers the path that a Muslim follows to seek knowledge a path that actually leads to Paradise. As the prophet ﷺ said, “Whoever treads a path in search of knowledge, Allah will ease the way to Paradise for him.” (Saheeh Ibn Hibbaan: 84)||<p>In fact, Islam has never witnessed a conflict between religion and science, as is the case in other religions. On the contrary, it has always supported it and called its adherents to acquire it and teach it to others as long as it is bound to benefit mankind.||<p>Islam even honours those who teach people and impart knowledge to them, holding them in high esteem and promising them abundant rewards. The prophet ﷺ informs us in one of his traditions that all Allah’s creation prays for those who impart beneficial knowledge to people. (Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 2685)",

The prophet ﷺ once described it as “the pillar of religion.” (Sunan At-Tirmidhee: 2749). This means it is the pillar upon which Islam is firmly established. A pillar is a post that is used to support a building, without which the building will collapse.||<p>However, for the prayer to be valid, a Muslim must offer it after purifying himself.

Indeed, the intellect is one of the greatest blessings Allah has bestowed upon us; it is the very faculty by which Allah has honoured man and favoured him over other creatures; it is also the reason that makes him subject to accountability in this life and in the hereafter.||<p>It is for this reason that Allah ﷻ has forbidden all types of intoxicants and drugs, which He describes as an abomination of Satan’s handiwork: “O you who believe, intoxicants, gambling, stone altars and divining arrows are abominations devised by Satan. Avoid them so that you may be successful.” (Soorat Al-Maa’idah, 5:90)||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"4\">Progeny :||<div id=\"right-image\">||<div class=\"mosaic-block bar\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 280px;\">||<caption> Preservation of one’s honour and lineage is one of the loftiest objectives of Islamic Law (Sharee‛ah).||<img src=\"http://newmuslimguide.com/sites/newmuslimguide.com/files/book-images/255.jpg\" />||<p>Islam stresses the importance of preserving progeny and starting a family in which the new generation acquire good manners and learn lofty principles. This is clear in a number of rulings which include the following:||<ul>||<li>It encourages marriage and prompts its adherents to make it easy for the unmarried people with the least expenses: “Marry off those among you who are unmarried.” (Soorat An-Noor, 24:32)||<li>It prohibits all sinful, illicit relationships and has blocks all the ways leading to them: “Do not go near to fornication. It is an indecent act and an evil way.” (Soorat Al-Israa’, 17:32)||<li>It forbids slandering or defaming people’s lineage and considers this act a major sin for which the perpetrator is subject to a specified punishment in this life in addition to severe chastisement in the hereafter.||<li>It commands its adherents to preserve people’s honour and considers a person who is killed defending his honour or that of his family, a martyr. (See page 203)||<ol class=\"rounded-list\">||<li value=\"5\">Property :||<p>Islam urges its followers to protect their property and preserve their wealth and commands them to earn a living, making all commercial transactions lawful.||<p>In order to protect wealth, it considers usury, deception and misappropriation of people’s wealth by using wrongful means, strictly forbidden. The Qur’an warns perpetrators of such acts, of severe punishments. (See page 172)",
